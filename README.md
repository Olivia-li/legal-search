## Python Virtual environment
To run the virtual environment run `source ./bin/active`
</br>
Now you can install dependencies in the virtual env using `pip3 install`
</br>
</br>
If you are new to the repo or need dependencies that someone else has installed run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
</br>
Before pushing, if you have added new dependencies run `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` so everyone else can grab your dependencies
