“Series B-3 Preferred Stock” or the “Shares”), of Groundfloor Finance Inc., a Georgia corporation
(the “Company’), at a purchase price of $43.90 per share of Series B-3 Preferred Stock (the “Per
Security Price”), rounded down to the nearest whole share based on Investor’s subscription
amount, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein (the “Subscription”). The purchase price
of the Shares is payable in the manner provided in Section 3(a) below. The rights and preferences

Commission (the “SEC”). By subscribing to the Offering, Investor acknowledges that Investor has
received a copy of the Offering Statement and any other information required by Investor to make
an investment decision with respect to the Shares.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall
have no obligation to issue any of the Shares to any person who is a resident of a jurisdiction in

subscription is accepted (whether in whole or in part) or rejected. If Investor’s subscription is
rejected, Investor's payment (or portion thereof if partially rejected) will be returned to Investor
without interest and all of Investor’s obligations hereunder shall terminate. Tendered funds will be
transmitted promptly to the Escrow Agent (as hereinafter defined), and returned promptly to
Investor if the Minimum Offering (as hereinafter defined) is not met prior to the Termination Date.

(d) The aggregate number of shares of Series B-3 Preferred Stock that may be sold by
the Company in this offering shall not exceed 230,000 shares (the “Maximum Shares”). The

“Termination Date’). Providing that all requirements for a closing are met, the Company may
elect at any time to close all or any portion of this offering on various dates at or prior to the
Termination Date (each a “Closing’’).

(e) In the event of rejection of this subscription in its entirety, or in the event the sale
of the Shares (or any portion thereof) to Investor is not consummated for any reason, this
Subscription Agreement shall have no force or effect, except for Section 6 hereof, which shall
remain in force and effect.

(f) The terms of this Subscription Agreement shall be binding upon Investor and its
transferees, heirs, successors and assigns (collectively, “Transferees”); provided that for any such
transfer to be deemed effective, (1) the Transferee shall have executed and delivered to the
Company in advance an instrument in a form acceptable to the Company in its sole discretion,
pursuant to which the proposed Transferee shall acknowledge, agree, and be bound by the
representations and warranties of Investor, terms of this Subscription Agreement, and (ii) the
Company consents to the transfer, in its sole discretion.

dated as of the initial Closing, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
“Investors’ Rights Agreement’). Any notice required or permitted to be given to Investor under
the Investors’ Rights Agreement shall be given to Investor at the address provided with Investor’s
subscription. Investor confirms that Investor has reviewed the Investors’ Rights Agreement and
will be bound by the terms thereof as a party who is designated as an “Investor” under the

warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or encumber, directly or indirectly, any Shares or
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such Shares, or other securities of the Company,
nor shall Investor enter into any swap, hedging or other arrangement that transfers to another, in
whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Shares or Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion of such Shares, or other securities of the Company, during the period
from the filing of the first registration statement of the Company filed under the Securities Act,
that includes securities to be sold on behalf of the Company to the public in an underwritten public
offering under the Securities Act through the end of the 180-day period following the effective

affecting the Company’s outstanding capital stock effected without receipt of consideration, then
any new, substituted, or additional securities distributed with respect to any Shares or Common

(a) Authorization. All requisite action on the part of the Company, its officers, directors
and stockholders necessary for the authorization, execution and delivery of the Shares and the
performance of all obligations of the Company hereunder and thereunder has been taken or will
be taken prior to the issuance of the Shares to the Investor, and this Agreement constitutes a valid
and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except
(i) as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and other laws or

Securities Laws, including a legend in form substantially as follows:

“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE “ACT”’) AND MAY NOT BE

401378109.3
OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR
HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT OR, IN
THE OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER OF THESE
SECURITIES, SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR
HYPOTHECATION OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE ACT.

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO A LOCK
UP PERIOD OF UP TO 180 DAYS FOLLOWING THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF A
REGISTRATION STATEMENT OF THE COMPANY FILED UNDER THE ACT, AS
SET FORTH IN AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ISSUER AND THE ORIGINAL
HOLDER OF THESE SHARES, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED AT THE
PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE ISSUER. SUCH LOCK UP PERIOD IS BINDING ON
TRANSFEREES OF THESE SHARES.

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO
CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER HELD BY THE ISSUER OR ITS
ASSIGNEE(S) AS SET FORTH IN THE SERIES B-3 PREFERRED STOCK
SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ISSUER AND THE ORIGINAL
HOLDER OF THESE SHARES, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED AT THE
PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE ISSUER. SUCH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ARE
BINDING ON TRANSFEREES OF THESE SHARES.”

6. Representations and Warranties of Investor. By subscribing to the Offering, Investor
(and, if Investor is purchasing the Shares subscribed for hereby in a fiduciary capacity, the person
or persons for whom Investor is so purchasing) represents and warrants, which representations and
warranties are true and complete in all material respects as of the date of each Closing:

(a) Organization, Requisite Power and Authority. Investor is an entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization with the
requisite power and authority to enter into and to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Investors’ Rights Agreement, and otherwise to carry out its obligations
hereunder and thereunder. Investor has all necessary power and authority under all applicable
provisions of law to subscribe to the Offering, to execute and deliver this Subscription Agreement,
to join as a party to the Investors’ Rights Agreement, and to carry out the provisions of such
respective agreements. All action on Investor’s part required for the lawful subscription to the
offering have been or will be effectively taken prior to the Closing. Upon subscribing to the
Offering, this Subscription Agreement and the Investors’ Rights Agreement will be valid and
binding obligations of Investor, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except (i)
as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws of
general application affecting enforcement of creditors’ rights and (ii) as limited by general
principles of equity that restrict the availability of equitable remedies.

 

(b) Company Information. Investor has access to information regarding the
Company’s business, management and financial affairs with directors, officers and management
of the Company and has had the opportunity to review the Company’s disclosures. Investor
acknowledges that except as set forth herein, no representations or warranties have been made to

401378109.3
Investor, or to Investor’s advisors or representative, by the Company or others with respect to the
business or prospects of the Company or its financial condition.

(c) Investment Experience. Investor has sufficient experience in financial and business
matters to be capable of utilizing such information to evaluate the merits and risks of Investor’s
investment in the Shares, and to make an informed decision relating thereto; or Investor has utilized
the services of a purchaser representative and together they have sufficient experience in financial
and business matters that they are capable of utilizing such information to evaluate the merits and
risks of Investor’s investment in the Shares, and to make an informed decision relating thereto.

(d) Investor Determination of Suitability. Investor has evaluated the risks of an
investment in the Shares, including those described in the section of the Form C captioned “Risk
Factors’, and has determined that the investment is suitable for Investor. Investor has adequate
financial resources for an investment of this character, and at this time Investor could bear a
complete loss of Investor’s investment in the Company.

(e) No Registration. Investor understands that the Shares are not being registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act’), on the ground that the issuance
thereof is exempt under Regulation CF of Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act, and that reliance
on such exemption is predicated in part on the truth and accuracy of Investor’s representations and
warranties, and those of the other purchasers of the Shares in the offering. Investor further
understands that the Shares are not being registered under the securities laws of any states on the
basis that the issuance thereof is exempt as an offer and sale not involving a registerable public
offering in such state, since the Shares are “covered securities” under the National Securities
Market Improvement Act of 1996. Investor covenants not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
any Shares unless such Shares have been registered under the Securities Act and under applicable
state securities laws, or exemptions from such registration requirements are available.

(f) Iliquidity and Continued Economic Risk. Investor acknowledges and agrees that
there is no ready public market for the Shares and that there is no guarantee that a market for their

resale will ever exist. The Company has no obligation to list any of the Shares on any market or
take any steps (including registration under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended) with respect to facilitating trading or resale of the Shares. Investor must bear
the economic risk of this investment indefinitely and Investor acknowledges that Investor is able
to bear the economic risk of losing Investor’s entire investment in the Shares.

 

(g) Accredited Investor Status or Investment Limits. Including the amount set forth on
the signature page hereto, in the past 12-month period, the undersigned has not exceeded the
investment limit as set forth in Rule 100(a)(2) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

(h) Reliance on Exemptions. Investor understands that the Shares are being offered
and sold to it in reliance on specific exemptions from the registration requirements of United States
federal and state securities laws and that the Company is relying in part upon the truth and accuracy
of, and Investor’s compliance with, the representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgments
and understandings of Investor set forth herein in order to determine the availability of such
exemptions and the eligibility of Investor to acquire the Shares.

401378109.3
(i) Stockholder Information. Within five days after receipt of a request from the
Company, Investor hereby agrees to provide such information with respect to its status as a
stockholder (or potential stockholder) and to execute and deliver such documents as may
reasonably be necessary to comply with any and all laws and regulations to which the Company
is or may become subject, including, without limitation, the need to determine the accredited status
of the Company’s stockholders. Investor further agrees that in the event it transfers any Shares, it
will require the transferee of such Shares to agree to provide such information to the Company as
a condition of such transfer.

(qj) Valuation. Investor acknowledges that the price of the shares of Series B-3
Preferred Stock to be sold in this offering was set by the Company on the basis of the Company’s
internal valuation and no warranties are made as to value. Investor further acknowledges that future
offerings of securities of the Company may be made at lower valuations, with the result that
Investor’s investment will bear a lower valuation.

(k) No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance by Investor of this
Agreement and the Investors’ Rights Agreement and the consummation by such Investor of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not (i) result in a violation of the organizational
documents of such Investor, or (ii) conflict with, or constitute a default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any agreement, indenture or instrument
to which such Investor is a party, or (iii) result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree (including federal and state securities laws) applicable to such Investor.

() Reserved.

7. Indemnity. The representations, warranties and covenants made by Investor herein shall
survive the closing of this Subscription Agreement. Investor agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its respective officers, directors and affiliates, and each other person,
if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act against
any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever (including, but not limited to,
any and all reasonable attorneys’ fees, including attorneys’ fees on appeal) and expenses
reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any false representation or
warranty or breach or failure by Investor to comply with any covenant or agreement made by
Investor herein or in any other document furnished by Investor to any of the foregoing in
connection with this transaction.

8. Arbitration.

(a) Unless you opt out as provided pursuant to Section 8(b) below, either party to this
Agreement may, at its sole election, require that the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for
resolution of a Claim be final and binding arbitration pursuant to this Section 8 (the “Arbitration
Provision”), except with respect to any Claim alleging violation of federal securities laws by
Groundfloor or any of its officers or directors (a “Securities Claim”). Unless otherwise agreed to
in writing by Groundfloor, the arbitration shall be conducted in Atlanta, Georgia. “Claim” shall
include any past, present, or future claim, dispute, or controversy involving you (or persons
claiming through or connected with you), on the one hand, and Groundfloor (or persons claiming

401378109.3
through or connected with Groundfloor), on the other hand, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement and/or the activities or relationships that involve, lead to, or result from any of the
foregoing, including (except to the extent provided otherwise in the last sentence of Section 8(f)
below) the validity or enforceability of this Arbitration Provision, any part thereof, or the entire
Agreement. Claims are subject to arbitration regardless of whether they arise from contract; tort
(intentional or otherwise); a constitution, statute, common law, or principles of equity; or
otherwise. Claims include matters arising as initial claims, counter-claims, cross-claims, third-
party claims, or otherwise. The scope of this Arbitration Provision is to be given the broadest
possible interpretation that is enforceable.

(b) You may opt out of this Arbitration Provision for all purposes by sending an
arbitration opt out notice to Groundfloor Finance Inc., 600 Peachtree Street NE, Suite 810, Atlanta,
GA 30308, Attention: Brian Dally, Chief Executive Officer, that is received at the specified
address within 30 days of the date of your first electronic acceptance of the terms of this
Agreement. The opt out notice must clearly state that you are rejecting arbitration; identify the
Agreement to which it applies by date; provide your name, address, and social security or TIN-
number; and be signed by you. You may send the opt out notice in any manner you see fit as long
as it is received at the specified address within the specified time. No other methods can be used
to opt out of this Arbitration Provision. If the opt out notice is sent on your behalf by a third party,
such third party must include evidence of his or her authority to submit the opt out notice on your
behalf.

(c) The party initiating arbitration shall do so with the American Arbitration
Association (the “AAA”) or JAMS. The arbitration shall be conducted according to, and the
location of the arbitration shall be determined in accordance with, the rules and policies of the
administrator selected, except to the extent the rules conflict with this Arbitration Provision or any
countervailing law. In the case of a conflict between the rules and policies of the administrator and
this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision shall control, subject to countervailing law,
unless all parties to the arbitration consent to have the rules and policies of the administrator apply.

(d) If we elect arbitration, we shall pay all of the administrator’s filing costs and
administrative fees (other than hearing fees). If you elect arbitration, filing costs and administrative
fees (other than hearing fees) shall be paid in accordance with the rules of the administrator
selected, or in accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the administrator’s rules. We shall
pay the administrator’s hearing fees for one full day of arbitration hearings. Fees for hearings that
exceed one day will be paid by the party requesting the hearing, unless the administrator’s rules or
applicable law require otherwise, or you request that we pay them and we agree to do so. Each
party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys’ fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a
statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights shall apply in the
arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.

(e) Within 30 days of a final award by the arbitrator, any party may appeal the award
for reconsideration by a three-arbitrator panel selected according to the rules of the arbitrator
administrator. In the event of such an appeal, any opposing party may cross-appeal within 30 days
after notice of the appeal. The panel will reconsider de novo all aspects of the initial award that
are appealed. Costs and conduct of any appeal shall be governed by this Arbitration Provision and
the administrator’s rules, in the same way as the initial arbitration proceeding. Any award by the

9
401378109.3
individual arbitrator that is not subject to appeal, and any panel award on appeal, shall be final and
binding, except for any appeal right under the Federal Arbitration Act ( the “FAA”), and may be
entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(f) We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate an individual Claim you may bring in
Small Claims Court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that
court. NO ARBITRATION SHALL PROCEED ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR
COLLECTIVE BASIS (INCLUDING AS PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON BEHALF OF
OTHERS), EVEN IF THE CLAIM OR CLAIMS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE
ARBITRATION HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ASSERTED (OR COULD HAVE BEEN
ASSERTED) IN A COURT AS CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS IN
A COURT. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, no party to the
arbitration may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims for or on behalf of two or more
individuals or unrelated corporate entities in the same arbitration unless those persons are parties
to a single transaction. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, an award in
arbitration shall determine the nghts and obligations of the named parties only, and only with
respect to the claims in arbitration, and shall not (i) determine the rights, obligations, or interests
of anyone other than a named party, or resolve any Claim of anyone other than a named party; nor
(ii) make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone other than a named party. No administrator
or arbitrator shall have the power or authority to waive, modify, or fail to enforce this Section 8(f),
and any attempt to do so, whether by rule, policy, arbitration decision or otherwise, shall be invalid
and unenforceable. Any challenge to the validity of this Section 8(f) shall be determined
exclusively by a court and not by the administrator or any arbitrator.

(g) This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate
commerce and shall be governed by and enforceable under the FAA. The arbitrator will apply
substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations. The arbitrator
may award damages or other types of relief permitted by applicable substantive law, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Arbitration Provision. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial
tules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court. The arbitrator shall take steps to
reasonably protect confidential information.

(h) This Arbitration Provision shall survive (i) suspension, termination, revocation,
closure, or amendments to this Agreement and the relationship of the parties and (ii) the bankruptcy
or insolvency of any party or other person.. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision other than
Section 8(f) is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of this Arbitration
Provision shall nevertheless remain valid and in force. If an arbitration is brought on a class,
representative, or collective basis, and the limitations on such proceedings in Section 8(f) are
finally adjudicated pursuant to the last sentence of Section 8(f) to be unenforceable, then no
arbitration shall be had. In no event shall any invalidation be deemed to authorize an arbitrator to
determine Claims or make awards beyond those authorized in this Arbitration Provision.

THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS
THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF ANY
PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. THE

10
401378109.3
PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO
LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A COURT UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY ANY
PARTY.

INVESTORS’ RIGHTS AGREEMENT

THIS INVESTORS’ RIGHTS AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is made as of August, 2022,
by and among Groundfloor Finance Inc., a Georgia corporation (the “Company”), and
[ENTITY NAME] , a Delaware series limited liability company (“Investor”).

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, in order to induce the Company to enter into the Series B-3 Preferred Stock
Subscription Agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”), and to induce the Investor to invest
funds in the Company pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the Investor and the Company
hereby agree that this Agreement shall govern the obligation of the Investor to undertake certain
actions in the event of a merger or acquisition of the Company; and

WHEREAS, the Company seeks to provide those same above referenced rights to all
subsequent holders of such Series B-3 Preferred Stock following a transfer by the Investor, and
prior to the termination of this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants set forth
herein, and other consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

1. Definitions.

1.1. “Joinder” means any document or agreement evidencing the Investor's
intention to become party to this Agreement.

1.2. “Person” means any individual, corporation, partnership, trust, limited
liability company, association, or other entity.

1.3. “Preferred Stock” means the Company’s Series Seed Preferred Stock,
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock, and any other
classes of capital stock of the Company designated as preferred stock by the Company. For
avoidance of doubt, this term does not refer to Series B-3 Preferred Stock.

1.4. “Series B-3 Preferred Stock” means shares of the Company’s Series B-3
Preferred Stock, no par value per share.

1.5. “Subscription Agreement” means the Series B-3 Preferred Stock
Subscription Agreement of even date herewith by and among the Company and certain of the
Investor.

1.6.  “Transferee” means any Person who has acquired Series B-3 Preferred
Stock from an Investor and not from the Company.

2. Drag Along.

401434385.2 1
2.1. In the event that (i) the Board, (ii) the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock then held by the Founders and (iii) the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series
B-2 Preferred Stock, and any other classes of shares provided for in the Company’s Fifth
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended or restated (together, the
“Requisite Holders”) approve any act or transaction described in Section 3 of the Company’s
Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Restated Certificate”), as
amended or restated (an “Approved Sale”), (x) if the Approved Sale is structured as a merger or
consolidation of the Company, or a sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, the
Investor agrees to raise no objections to such Approved Sale, and to waive and refrain from
exercising any dissenters rights, appraisal rights or similar rights in connection with such merger,
consolidation or asset sale or (y) if the Approved Sale is structured as a sale of the stock of the
Company, the Investor agrees to sell the Series B-3 Preferred Stock and any other shares held by
such Investor on the terms and conditions approved by the Requisite Holders. Subject to the
foregoing, the Investor shall take all necessary and desirable actions approved by the Requisite
Holders in connection with the consummation of the Approved Sale, including the execution of
such agreements and such instruments and other actions reasonably necessary to (1) provide the
representations, warranties, indemnities, covenants, conditions, non-compete agreements, escrow
agreements and other provisions and agreements relating to such Approved Sale and (2)
effectuate the allocation and distribution of the aggregate consideration upon the Approved Sale.

3. [Reserved].
4. Additional Rights and Obligations

 

4.1. Information Rights. The Company shall deliver to the Investor, provided
that the Board of Directors has reasonably determined that such Investor is not a competitor of
the Company: annual unaudited financial statements for each fiscal year of the Company. If the
Company has audited records of any of the foregoing, it will provide those in lieu of the
unaudited versions. Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.1 to the contrary, the
Company may cease providing the information set forth in this Section 4.1 during the period
starting with the date sixty (60) days before the Company’s good-faith estimate of the date of
filing of a registration statement if it reasonably concludes it must do so to comply with the SEC
tules applicable to such registration statement and related offering; provided that the Company’s
covenants under this Section 4.1 shall be reinstated at such time as the Company is no longer
actively employing its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to
become effective.

4.2. Inspection Rights) The Company will provide Investor with those
documents and records required by Regulation CF or other applicable SEC rules and
regulations; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to
this Subsection 4.2 to provide access to any information that it reasonably and in good faith
considers to be a trade secret or confidential information (unless covered by an enforceable
confidentiality agreement, in form acceptable to the Company) or the disclosure of which would

401434385.2
adversely affect the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel.

4.3. Voting. Each Investor shall have five (5) calendar days after receipt of
notice (the “Notice Period”) of any action subject to a vote of such Investor. If an Investor fails
to vote within the Notice Period, such failure will serve as authorization for the Board to vote
such Investor’s shares in alignment with the majority of all voting stockholders, provided,
however, that the Company may elect, in its sole discretion to extend the Notice Period by an
additional five (5) calendar days. In connection herewith, the Investor, hereby appoints the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company or his designee, as the Investor’s true and lawful proxy and
attorney, with the power to act alone and with full power of substitution, to vote all of the Series
B-3 Preferred Stock held by such Investor as set forth in this Section 4.3 and to execute all
appropriate instruments consistent with this Agreement on behalf of such Investor if, and only if,
such Investor fails to vote all of the Series B-3 Preferred Stock held by such Investor or execute
such other instruments in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement within the Notice
Period (including any extensions granted by the Company) or the Company’s or any other
party’s written request for the Investor’s written consent or signature. The proxy and the power
granted by the Investor pursuant to the Section 4.3 are coupled with an interest and are given to
secure the performance of each party’s duties under this Agreement. Each such proxy and power
will be irrevocable for the term hereof. The proxy and power, so long as any party hereto is an
individual, will survive the death, incompetency, and disability of such party or any other
individual holder of the Series B-3 Preferred Stock and, so long as any party hereto is an entity,
will survive the merger or reorganization of such party or any other entity holding Series B
Preferred Stock.

44. No Preemption Rights. Investor will not have any preemption rights in
future offerings of preferred or common stock.

5. Obligations on Transfer.

5.1. Joinder of Transferee. It will be a condition of the transfer of the Series B-
3 Preferred Stock held by Investor that any such Transferee become party to this Agreement.
Neither the Company not its transfer agent, if any, shall recognize such transfer unless presented
with evidence of such Transferee’s acceptance of this Agreement in a form substantially similar
to the form of Joinder included in Exhibit A hereto.

6. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect
(i) immediately before the consummation of an initial public offering registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 by the Company, (ii) when the Company first becomes subject to the
periodic reporting requirements of Section 12(g) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or (iii) upon a
Deemed Liquidation Event, as such term is defined in the Restated Certificate, whichever event
occurs first.

7. Governing Law: Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia.

401434385.2
EACH OF INVESTOR AND THE COMPANY CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION
OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED
WITHIN THE STATE OF GEORGIA AND NO OTHER PLACE AND IRREVOCABLY
AGREES THAT ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
MAY BE LITIGATED IN SUCH COURTS. EACH OF INVESTOR AND THE COMPANY
ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS RESPECTIVE PROPERTIES,
GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE
AFORESAID COURTS AND WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS,
AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ANY JUDGMENT RENDERED
THEREBY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INVESTORS’ RIGHTS AGREEMENT.
INVESTOR AND THE COMPANY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE
SERVICE OF PROCESS OUT OF ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS IN THE
MANNER AND IN THE ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 8. HOWEVER, NOTHING IN
THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO BE APPLICABLE TO ANY ACTION
ARISING UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS.

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS INVESTORS’ RIGHTS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF
EITHER PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT THEREOF, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO ALSO WAIVES ANY
BOND OR SURETY OR SECURITY UPON SUCH BOND WHICH MIGHT, BUT FOR THIS
WAIVER, BE REQUIRED OF SUCH PARTY. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER
WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY
WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL
COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE
MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO
ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR
MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS
AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.
BY AGREEING TO THIS PROVISION, EACH PARTY WILL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE
WAIVED THE COMPANY’S COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS
AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER.

Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein shall be in writing and shall be deemed to

date hereof, any purchaser of such shares of Series B-3 Preferred Stock may become a party to
this Agreement by executing and delivering an additional counterpart signature page to this
Agreement, and thereafter shall be deemed an “Investor” for all purposes hereunder. No action or
consent by the Investor shall be required for such joinder to this Agreement by such additional
Investor, so long as such additional Investor has agreed in writing to be bound by all of the
obligations as an “Investor” hereunder.

10. Confidentiality. Each Investor agrees that such Investor will keep confidential
and will not disclose, divulge, or use for any purpose (other than to monitor its investment in the
