            <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
            <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
                <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
                <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2021), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
                <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>

                <P>
                    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. 
                    <PRTPAGE P="viii"/>
                    Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

                <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time.

                <P>
                    <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E>
                     Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
                </P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E>
                     The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
                </P>
                <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
                <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
                <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E>
                     If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.

                        <P>(3) The short sale order of a covered security is for a good faith account of a person who then owns another security by virtue of which he is, or presently will be, entitled to acquire an equivalent number of securities of the same class as the securities sold; provided such sale, or the purchase which such sale offsets, is effected for the bona fide purpose of profiting from a current difference between the price of the security sold and the security owned and that such right of acquisition was originally attached to or represented by another security or was issued to all the holders of any such securities of the issuer.</P>
                        <P>(4) The short sale order of a covered security is for a good faith account and submitted to profit from a current price difference between a security on a foreign securities market and a security on a securities market subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, provided that the short seller has an offer to buy on a foreign market that allows the seller to immediately cover the short sale at the time it was made. For the purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), a depository receipt of a security shall be deemed to be the same security as the security represented by such receipt.</P>
                        <P>(5)(i) The short sale order of a covered security is by an underwriter or member of a syndicate or group participating in the distribution of a security in connection with an over-allotment of securities; or</P>
                        <P>(ii) The short sale order of a covered security is for purposes of a lay-off sale by an underwriter or member of a syndicate or group in connection with a distribution of securities through a rights or standby underwriting commitment.</P>
                        <P>(6) The short sale order of a covered security is by a broker or dealer effecting the execution of a customer purchase or the execution of a customer “long” sale on a riskless principal basis. In addition, for purposes of this paragraph (d)(6), a broker or dealer must have written policies and procedures in place to assure that, at a minimum:</P>
                        <P>(i) The customer order was received prior to the offsetting transaction;</P>
                        <P>(ii) The offsetting transaction is allocated to a riskless principal or customer account within 60 seconds of execution; and</P>
                        <P>(iii) The broker or dealer has supervisory systems in place to produce records that enable the broker or dealer to accurately and readily reconstruct, in a time-sequenced manner, all orders on which a broker or dealer relies pursuant to this exception.</P>
                        <P>(7) The short sale order is for the sale of a covered security at the volume weighted average price (VWAP) that meets the following criteria:</P>
                        <P>(i) The VWAP for the covered security is calculated by:</P>
                        <P>(A) Calculating the values for every regular way trade reported in the consolidated system for the security during the regular trading session, by multiplying each such price by the total number of shares traded at that price;</P>
                        <P>(B) Compiling an aggregate sum of all values; and</P>
                        <P>(C) Dividing the aggregate sum by the total number of reported shares for that day in the security.</P>
                        <P>(ii) The transactions are reported using a special VWAP trade modifier.</P>
                        <P>(iii) The VWAP matched security:</P>
                        <P>(A) Qualifies as an “actively-traded security” pursuant to § 242.101 and § 242.102; or</P>
                        <P>(B) The proposed short sale transaction is being conducted as part of a basket transaction of twenty or more securities in which the subject security does not comprise more than 5% of the value of the basket traded.</P>
                        <P>(iv) The transaction is not effected for the purpose of creating actual, or apparent, active trading in or otherwise affecting the price of any security.</P>
                        <P>
                            (v) A broker or dealer shall be permitted to act as principal on the contra-side to fill customer short sale orders only if the broker's or dealer's position in the covered security, as committed by the broker or dealer during the pre-opening period of a trading day and aggregated across all of its customers who propose to sell short the same security on a VWAP basis, does not exceed 10% of the covered security's relevant average daily trading volume.

If the person has not delivered such security within 35 days after the trade date, the broker-dealer that effected the sale must borrow securities or close out the short position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity;</P>

                        <P>This section requires market centers to make available standardized, monthly reports of statistical information concerning their order executions. This information is presented in accordance with uniform standards that are based on broad assumptions about order execution and routing practices. The information will provide a starting point to promote visibility and competition on the part of market centers and broker-dealers, particularly on the factors of execution price and speed. The disclosures required by this section do not encompass all of the factors that may be important to investors in evaluating the order routing services of a broker-dealer. In addition, any particular market center's statistics will encompass varying types of orders routed by different broker-dealers on behalf of customers with a wide range of objectives. Accordingly, the statistical information required by this section alone does not create a reliable basis to address whether any particular broker-dealer failed to obtain the most favorable terms reasonably available under the circumstances for customer orders.</P>

                        <P>(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a proposed amendment may be put into effect summarily upon publication of notice of such amendment, on a temporary basis not to exceed 120 days, if the Commission finds that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors or the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.</P>

                        </P>

                        <P>(7) The transaction that constituted the trade-through was the execution of an order at a price that was not based, directly or indirectly, on the quoted price of the NMS stock at the time of execution and for which the material terms were not reasonably determinable at the time the commitment to execute the order was made.</P>
                        <P>(8) The trading center displaying the protected quotation that was traded through had displayed, within one second prior to execution of the transaction that constituted the trade-through, a best bid or best offer, as applicable, for the NMS stock with a price that was equal or inferior to the price of the trade-through transaction.</P>
                        <P>(9) The transaction that constituted the trade-through was the execution by a trading center of an order for which, at the time of receipt of the order, the trading center had guaranteed an execution at no worse than a specified price (a “stopped order”), where:</P>
                        <P>(i) The stopped order was for the account of a customer;</P>

                            <P>
                                This appendix sets forth guidelines applicable to reports that the Commission has directed its staff to make in connection with the determination of block thresholds and reporting delays for security-based swap transaction data. The Commission intends to use these reports to inform its specification of the criteria for determining what constitutes a large notional security-based swap transaction (block trade) for particular markets and contracts; and the appropriate time delay for reporting large notional security-based swap transactions (block trades) to the public in order to implement regulatory requirements under Section 13 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78m). In producing these reports, the staff shall consider security-based swap data collected by the Commission pursuant to 
                                <PRTPAGE P="92"/>
                                other Title VII rules, as well as any other applicable information as the staff may determine to be appropriate for its analysis.

                                 As appropriate, based on the availability of data and information, the reports should address the following topics for each asset class:

                                 In connection with the Commission's obligation to specify criteria for determining what constitutes a block trade and the appropriate reporting delay for block trades, the report generally should assess the effect of notional amount and observed reporting delay on price impact of trades in the security-based swap market.

                                 In connection with the Commission's obligation to specify criteria for determining what constitutes a block trade and the appropriate reporting delay for block trades, the report generally should consider potential relationships between observed reporting delays and the incidence and cost of hedging large trades in the security-based swap market, and whether these relationships differ for interdealer trades and dealer to customer trades.

                                 In connection with the Commission's obligation to specify criteria for determining what constitutes a block trade and the appropriate reporting delay for block trades, the report generally should assess the relationship between reporting delays and the speed with which transaction information is impounded into market prices, estimating this relationship for trades of different notional amounts.

                             This part (Regulation RR) is issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) jointly with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and, in the case of the securitization of any residential mortgage asset, together with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, pursuant to Section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-11). The Commission also is issuing this part pursuant to its authority under Sections 7, 10, 19(a), and 28 of the Securities Act and Sections 3, 13, 15, 23, and 36 of the Exchange Act. This part requires securitizers to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk for any asset that the securitizer, through the issuance of an asset-backed security, transfers, sells, or conveys to a third party. This part specifies the permissible types, forms, and amounts of credit risk retention, and establishes certain exemptions for securitizations collateralized by assets that meet specified underwriting standards or otherwise qualify for an exemption.

                        <P>(b) The authority of the Commission under this part shall be in addition to the authority of the Commission to otherwise enforce the federal securities laws, including, without limitation, the antifraud provisions of the securities laws.</P>

                             Except with respect to § 248.30(b), this subpart applies only to nonpublic personal information about individuals who obtain financial products or services primarily for personal, family, or household purposes from the institutions listed below.

It also applies to foreign (non-resident) brokers, dealers, investment companies and investment advisers that are registered with the Commission. These entities are referred to in this subpart as “you.” This subpart does not apply to foreign (non-resident) brokers, dealers, investment companies and investment advisers that are not registered with the Commission. Nothing in this subpart modifies, limits, or supersedes the standards governing individually identifiable health information promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the authority of sections 262 and 264 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 1320d-1320d-8).

For example, if a customer opens an account on any day of year 1, you must provide an annual notice to that customer by December 31 of year 2.

                            <P>(A) The only means of opting out is for the consumer to write his or her own letter to exercise that opt out right; or</P>
                            <P>(B) The only means of opting out as described in any notice subsequent to the initial notice is to use a check-off box that you provided with the initial notice but did not include with the subsequent notice.</P>

                            <P>(i) Send a single opt out notice to John's address, but you must accept an opt out direction from either John or Mary;</P>
                            <P>(ii) Treat an opt out direction by either John or Mary as applying to the entire account. If you do so, and John opts out, you may not require Mary to opt out as well before implementing John's opt out direction; or</P>

                                 You must provide any privacy notices and opt out notices, including short-form initial notices that this subpart requires so that each consumer can reasonably be expected to receive actual notice in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.

                                 You may reasonably expect that consumers who share an address will receive actual notice of your annual privacy notice if you deliver the notice with or in a stockholder or shareholder report under the conditions in 17 CFR 270.30d-1(f) or 17 CFR 270.30d-2(b), or with or in a prospectus under the conditions in 17 CFR 230.154.

                        <P>(a) The model form may be used, at the option of a financial institution, including a group of financial institutions that use a common privacy notice, to meet the content requirements of the privacy notice and opt-out notice set forth in §§ 248.6 and 248.7 of this part.</P>

                        <P>(c) Note that disclosure of certain information, such as assets, income, and information from a consumer reporting agency, may give rise to obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act [15 U.S.C. 1681-1681x] (FCRA), such as a requirement to permit a consumer to opt out of disclosures to affiliates or designation as a consumer reporting agency if disclosures are made to nonaffiliated third parties.</P>

                             This reason incorporates sharing information specified in section 624 of the FCRA. This reason may be omitted from the disclosure table when: the institution does not have affiliates (or does not disclose personal information to its affiliates); the institution's affiliates do not use personal information in a manner that requires an opt-out; or the institution provides the affiliate marketing notice separately. Institutions that include

An institution that is required to provide an affiliate marketing opt-out, but does not include that opt-out in the model form under this part, must comply with section 624 of the FCRA and 17 CFR part 248, subpart B, with respect to the initial notice and opt-out and any subsequent renewal notice and opt-out. An institution not required to provide an opt-out under this subparagraph may elect to include this reason in the model form.

Institutions must select one or more of the applicable opt-out methods described: telephone, such as by a toll-free number; a Web site; or use of a mail-in opt-out form. Institutions may include the words “toll-free” before telephone, as appropriate. An institution that allows consumers to opt out online must provide either a specific Web address that takes consumers directly to the opt-out page or a general Web address that provides a clear and conspicuous direct link to the opt-out page. The opt-out choices made available to the consumer who contacts the institution through these methods must correspond accurately to the “Yes” responses in the third column of the disclosure table. In the part titled “Please note” institutions may insert a number that is 30 or greater in the space marked “[30].” Instructions on voluntary or state privacy law opt-out information are in paragraph C.2(g)(5) of these Instructions.

The mail-in form must provide opt-out options that correspond accurately to the “Yes” responses in the third column in the disclosure table. Institutions that require customers to provide only name and address may omit the section identified as “[account #].” Institutions that require additional or different information, such as a random opt-out number or a truncated account number, to implement an opt-out election should modify the “[account #]” reference accordingly. This includes institutions that require customers with multiple accounts to identify each account to which the opt-out should apply. An institution must enter its opt-out mailing address: in the far right of this form (

                             of a company means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company whether through ownership of securities, by contract, or otherwise. Any person who owns beneficially, either directly or through one or more controlled companies, more than 25 percent of the voting securities of any company is presumed to control the company. Any person who does not own more than 25 percent of the voting securities of any company will be presumed not to control the company. Any presumption regarding control may be rebutted by evidence, but, in the case of an investment company, will continue until the Commission makes a decision to the contrary according to the procedures described in section 2(a)(9) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(9)).

                             The term “marketing solicitation” means the marketing of a product or service initiated by a person to a particular consumer that is:
                        </P>
                        <P>(i) Based on eligibility information communicated to that person by its affiliate as described in this subpart; and</P>

                             A marketing solicitation does not include marketing communications that are directed at the general public. For example, television, general circulation magazine, billboard advertisements and publicly available Web sites that are not directed to particular consumers would not constitute marketing solicitations, even if those communications are intended to encourage consumers to purchase products and services from the person initiating the communications.

                            (i) A financial contract between the person and the consumer which is in force on the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this subpart;

                        </P>
                        <P>(ii) The purchase, rental, or lease by the consumer of the person's goods or services, or a financial transaction (including holding an active account or a policy in force or having another continuing relationship) between the consumer and the person, during the 18-month period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this subpart; or</P>

                        <P>(ii) If a consumer has an investment advisory contract with a registered investment adviser, the investment adviser has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services.</P>
                        <P>(iii) If a consumer was the record owner of securities issued by an investment company, but the consumer redeems these securities, the investment company has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for 18 months after the date the consumer redeemed the investment company's securities.</P>

In these circumstances, the broker-dealer has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from the investment company to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the inquiry.</P>

Also, the affiliate's capture of the consumer's telephone number does not constitute an inquiry and does not establish a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and the affiliate.</P>

                             A consumer has a brokerage account with a broker-dealer. The broker-dealer furnishes eligibility information about the consumer to its affiliated investment adviser. Based on that eligibility information, the investment adviser wants to make a marketing solicitation to the consumer about its discretionary advisory accounts. The investment adviser does not have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and none of the other exceptions apply. The investment adviser is prohibited from using eligibility information received from its broker-dealer affiliate to make marketing solicitations to the consumer about its discretionary advisory accounts unless the consumer is given a notice and opportunity to opt out and the consumer does not opt out.

All relevant facts and circumstances will determine whether a person is acting as your service provider when it receives or uses an affiliate's eligibility information in connection with marketing your products and services.

                             (i) A consumer has an investment advisory contract with a registered investment adviser that is affiliated with a broker-dealer. The broker-dealer receives eligibility information about the consumer from the investment adviser. The broker-dealer uses that eligibility information to identify the consumer to receive a marketing solicitation about brokerage products and services, and, as a result, the broker-dealer provides a marketing solicitation to the consumer about its brokerage services. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the broker-dealer has made a marketing solicitation to the consumer.
                        </P>
                        <P>(ii) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, except that after using the eligibility information to identify the consumer to receive a marketing solicitation about brokerage products and services, the broker-dealer asks the registered investment adviser to send the marketing solicitation to the consumer and the investment adviser does so. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the broker-dealer has made a marketing solicitation to the consumer because it used eligibility information about the consumer that it received from an affiliate to identify the consumer to receive a marketing solicitation about its products or services, and, as a result, a marketing solicitation was provided to the consumer about the broker-dealer's products and services.</P>
                        <P>(iii) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, except that eligibility information about consumers who have an investment advisory contract with a registered investment adviser is placed into a common database that all members of the affiliated group of companies may independently access and use. Without using the investment adviser's eligibility information, the broker-dealer develops selection criteria and provides those criteria, marketing materials, and related instructions to the investment adviser. The investment adviser reviews eligibility information about its own consumers using the selection criteria provided by the broker-dealer to determine which consumers should receive the broker-dealer's marketing materials and sends the broker-dealer's marketing materials to those consumers. Even though the broker-dealer has received eligibility information through the common database as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it did not use that information to identify consumers or establish selection criteria; instead, the investment adviser used its own eligibility information. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the broker-dealer has not made a marketing solicitation to the consumer.</P>
                        <P>(iv) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section, except that the registered investment adviser provides the broker-dealer's criteria to the investment adviser's service provider and directs the service provider to use the investment adviser's eligibility information to identify investment adviser consumers who meet the criteria and to send the broker-dealer's marketing materials to those consumers. The broker-dealer does not communicate directly with the service provider regarding the use of the investment adviser's information to market its products or services to the investment adviser's consumers. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the broker-dealer has not made a marketing solicitation to the consumer.</P>
                        <P>
                            (v) An affiliated group of companies includes an investment company, a principal underwriter for the investment company, a retail broker-dealer, 
                            <PRTPAGE P="205"/>
                            and a transfer agent that also acts as a service provider. Each affiliate in the group places information about its consumers into a common database. The service provider has access to all information in the common database. The investment company controls access to and use of its eligibility information by the service provider. This control is set forth in a written agreement between the investment company and the service provider. The written agreement also requires the service provider to establish reasonable policies and procedures designed to ensure that the service provider uses the investment company's eligibility information in accordance with specific terms and conditions established by the investment company relating to the marketing of the products and services of all affiliates, including the principal underwriter and the retail broker-dealer. In a separate written communication, the investment company specifies the terms and conditions under which the service provider may use the investment company's eligibility information to market the retail broker-dealer's products and services to the investment company's consumers. The specific terms and conditions are: a list of affiliated companies (including the retail broker-dealer) whose products or services may be marketed to the investment company's consumers by the service provider; the specific products or services or types of products or services that may be marketed to the investment company's consumers by the service provider; the categories of eligibility information that may be used by the service provider in marketing products or services to the investment company's consumers; the types or categories of the investment company's consumers to whom the service provider may market products or services of investment company affiliates; the number and types of marketing communications that the service provider may send to the investment company's consumers; and the length of time during which the service provider may market the products or services of the investment company's affiliates to its consumers. The investment company periodically evaluates the service provider's compliance with these terms and conditions. The retail broker-dealer asks the service provider to market brokerage services to certain of the investment company's consumers. Without using the investment company's eligibility information, the retail broker-dealer develops selection criteria and provides those criteria, its marketing materials, and related instructions to the service provider. The service provider uses the investment company's eligibility information from the common database to identify the investment company's consumers to whom brokerage services will be marketed. When the retail broker-dealer's marketing materials are provided to the identified consumers, the name of the investment company is displayed on the retail broker-dealer's marketing materials, an introductory letter that accompanies the marketing materials, an account statement that accompanies the marketing materials, or the envelope containing the marketing materials. The requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this section have been satisfied, and the retail broker-dealer has not made a marketing solicitation to the consumer.
                        </P>
                        <P>(vi) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section, except that the terms and conditions permit the service provider to use the investment company's eligibility information to market the products and services of other affiliates to the investment company's consumers whenever the service provider deems it appropriate to do so. The service provider uses the investment company's eligibility information in accordance with the discretion afforded to it by the terms and conditions. Because the terms and conditions are not specific, the requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this section have not been satisfied.</P>

                        <P>(5) In response to an authorization or request by the consumer to receive solicitations; or</P>

                             A consumer has a brokerage account with a broker-dealer. The consumer also has a deposit account with the broker-dealer's affiliated depository institution. The broker-dealer receives eligibility information about the consumer from its depository institution affiliate and uses that information to make a marketing solicitation to the consumer about the broker-dealer's college savings accounts. The broker-dealer may make this marketing solicitation even if the consumer has not been given a notice and opportunity to opt out because the broker-dealer has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer.

                             (i) A consumer has a brokerage account with a broker-dealer. The broker-dealer furnishes eligibility information about the consumer to its affiliate, a registered investment adviser. Based on that eligibility information, the investment adviser wants to make a marketing solicitation to the consumer about its advisory services. The investment adviser does not have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and none of the other exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section apply. The consumer has been given an opt out notice and has elected to opt out of receiving such marketing solicitations. The investment adviser asks a service provider to send the marketing solicitation to the consumer on its behalf. The service provider may not send the marketing solicitation on behalf of the investment adviser because, as a result of the consumer's opt out election, the investment adviser is not permitted to make the marketing solicitation.
                        </P>
                        <P>(ii) The same facts as in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, except the consumer has been given an opt out notice, but has not elected to opt out. The investment adviser asks a service provider to send the solicitation to the consumer on its behalf. The service provider may send the marketing solicitation on behalf of the investment adviser because, as a result of the consumer's not opting out, the investment adviser is permitted to make the marketing solicitation.</P>

                             (i) A consumer who is the record owner of shares in an investment company initiates a communication with an affiliated registered investment adviser about advisory services. The affiliated investment adviser may use eligibility information about the consumer it obtains from the investment company or any other affiliate to make marketing solicitations regarding the affiliated investment adviser's services in response to the consumer-initiated communication.
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            (ii) A consumer who has a brokerage account with a broker-dealer contacts the broker-dealer to request information about how to save and invest for a child's college education without specifying the type of savings or investment vehicle in which the consumer may be interested. Information about a range of different products or services offered by the broker-dealer and one or more of its affiliates may be responsive to that communication. Such products, services, and investments may include the following: investments in affiliated investment companies; investments in section 529 plans offered by the broker-dealer; or trust services offered by a different financial institution in the affiliated group. Any affiliate offering 
                            <PRTPAGE P="207"/>
                            products or services that would be responsive to the consumer's request for information about saving and investing for a child's college education may use eligibility information to make marketing solicitations to the consumer in response to this communication.
                        </P>
                        <P>(iii) A registered investment adviser makes a marketing call to the consumer without using eligibility information received from an affiliate. The investment adviser leaves a voice-mail message that invites the consumer to call a toll-free number to receive information about services offered by the investment adviser. If the consumer calls the toll-free number to inquire about the investment advisory services, the call is a consumer-initiated communication about a product or service, and the investment adviser may now use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make marketing solicitations to the consumer.</P>
                        <P>(iv) A consumer calls a broker-dealer to ask about retail locations and hours, but does not request information about its products or services. The broker-dealer may not use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make marketing solicitations to the consumer because the consumer-initiated communication does not relate to the broker-dealer's products or services. Thus, the use of eligibility information received from an affiliate would not be responsive to the communication and the exception does not apply.</P>
                        <P>(v) A consumer calls a broker-dealer to ask about retail locations and hours. The customer service representative asks the consumer if there is a particular product or service about which the consumer is seeking information. The consumer responds that the consumer wants to stop in and find out about mutual funds (i.e., registered open-end investment companies). The customer service representative offers to provide that information by telephone and mail additional information to the consumer. The consumer agrees and provides or confirms contact information for receipt of the materials to be mailed. The broker-dealer may use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make marketing solicitations to the consumer about mutual funds because such marketing solicitations would respond to the consumer-initiated communication about mutual funds.</P>

                             (i) A consumer who has a brokerage account with a broker-dealer authorizes or requests information about life insurance offered by the broker-dealer's insurance affiliate. The authorization or request, whether given to the broker-dealer or the insurance affiliate, would permit the insurance affiliate to use eligibility information about the consumer it obtains from the broker-dealer or any other affiliate to make marketing solicitations to the consumer about life insurance.

                        <P>(ii) A consumer completes an online application to open an online brokerage account with a broker-dealer. The broker-dealer's online application contains a blank check box that the consumer may check to authorize or request information from the broker-dealer's affiliates. The consumer checks the box. The consumer has authorized or requested marketing solicitations from the broker-dealer's affiliates.</P>
                        <P>(iii) A consumer completes an online application to open an online brokerage account with a broker-dealer. The broker-dealer's online application contains a check box indicating that the consumer authorizes or requests information from the broker-dealer's affiliates. The consumer does not deselect the check box. The consumer has not authorized or requested marketing solicitations from the broker-dealer's affiliates.</P>
                        <P>(iv) The terms and conditions of a brokerage account agreement contain preprinted boilerplate language stating that by applying to open an account the consumer authorizes or requests to receive solicitations from the broker-dealer's affiliates. The consumer has not authorized or requested marketing solicitations from the broker-dealer's affiliates.</P>

                             You must not use eligibility information that you receive from an affiliate to make marketing solicitations to a consumer about your products or services unless the consumer is provided a reasonable opportunity to opt out, as required by § 248.121(a)(1)(ii).

                             The opt out notice is mailed to the consumer. The consumer is given 30 days from the date the notice is mailed to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.

                             (i) The opt out notice is provided electronically to the consumer, such as by posting the notice at an Internet Web site at which the consumer has obtained a product or service. The consumer acknowledges receipt of the electronic notice. The consumer is given 30 days after the date the consumer acknowledges receipt to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.
                        </P>
                        <P>(ii) The opt out notice is provided to the consumer by e-mail where the consumer has agreed to receive disclosures by e-mail from the person sending the notice. The consumer is given 30 days after the e-mail is sent to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.</P>

                             The opt out notice is provided to the consumer at the time of an electronic transaction, such as a transaction conducted on an Internet Web site. The consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of proceeding with the transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction. There is a simple process that the consumer may use to opt out at that time using the same mechanism through which the transaction is conducted.

                             The opt out notice is provided to the consumer in writing at the time of an in-person transaction. The consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of proceeding with the transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction, and is not permitted to complete the transaction without making a choice. There is a simple process that the consumer may use during the course of the in-person transaction to opt out, such as completing a form that requires consumers to write a “yes” or “no” to indicate their opt out preference or that requires the consumer to check one of two blank check boxes—one that allows consumers to indicate that they want to opt out and one that allows consumers to indicate that they do not want to opt out.

                             The opt out notice is included in a GLBA privacy notice. The consumer is allowed to exercise the opt out within a reasonable period of time and in the same manner as the opt out under that privacy notice.

                             The opt out notice must be provided so that each consumer can reasonably be expected to receive actual notice.

But if the affiliates providing the joint notice do not all share a common name, then the notice must either separately identify each affiliate by name or identify each of the common names used by those affiliates, for example, by stating that the notice is provided by “all of the ABC and XYZ companies” or by “the ABC banking and securities companies and the XYZ insurance companies”;</P>

But if the affiliates covered by the notice do not all share a common name, then the notice must either separately identify each covered affiliate by name or identify each of the common names used by those affiliates, for example, by stating that the notice applies to “all of the ABC and XYZ companies” or to “the ABC banking and securities companies and the XYZ insurance companies”;</P>

                        <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix to Subpart B of Part 248—Model Forms</HD>
                        <P>a. Although you and your affiliates are not required to use the model forms in this Appendix, use of a model form (if applicable to each person that uses it) complies with the requirement in section 624 of the FCRA for clear, conspicuous, and concise notices.</P>
                        <P>b. Although you may need to change the language or format of a model form to reflect your actual policies and procedures, any such changes may not be so extensive as to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the language in the model forms. Acceptable changes include, for example:</P>
                        <P>1. Rearranging the order of the references to “your income,” “your account history,” and “your credit score.”</P>
                        <P>2. Substituting other types of information for “income,” “account history,” or “credit score” for accuracy, such as “payment history,” “credit history,” “payoff status,” or “claims history.”</P>
                        <P>3. Substituting a clearer and more accurate description of the affiliates providing or covered by the notice for phrases such as “the [ABC] group of companies.”</P>
                        <P>4. Substituting other types of affiliates covered by the notice for “credit card,” “insurance,” or “securities” affiliates.</P>
                        <P>5. Omitting items that are not accurate or applicable. For example, if a person does not limit the duration of the opt out period, the notice may omit information about the renewal notice.</P>
                        <P>6. Adding a statement informing the consumer how much time they have to opt out before shared eligibility information may be used to make solicitations to them.</P>
                        <P>7. Adding a statement that the consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time.</P>
                        <P>8. Adding the following statement, if accurate: “If you previously opted out, you do not need to do so again.”</P>
                        <P>9. Providing a place on the form for the consumer to fill in identifying information, such as his or her name and address.</P>
                        <P>
                            10. Adding disclosures regarding the treatment of opt-outs by joint consumers to comply with § 248.123(a)(2), if applicable.

                        <P>The Program's policies and procedures should provide for appropriate responses to the Red Flags the financial institution or creditor has detected that are commensurate with the degree of risk posed. In determining an appropriate response, a financial institution or creditor should consider aggravating factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security incident that results in unauthorized access to a customer's account records held by the financial institution, creditor, or third party, or notice that a customer has provided information related to a covered account held by the financial institution or creditor to someone fraudulently claiming to represent the financial institution or creditor or to a fraudulent Web site. Appropriate responses may include the following:</P>

                             The report should address material matters related to the Program and evaluate issues such as: The effectiveness of the policies and procedures of the financial institution or creditor in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; service provider arrangements; significant incidents involving identity theft and management's response; and recommendations for material changes to the Program.

                             Whenever a financial institution or creditor engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more covered accounts the financial institution or creditor should take steps to ensure that the activity of the service provider is conducted in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. For example, a financial institution or creditor could require the service provider by contract to have policies and procedures to detect relevant Red Flags that may arise in the performance of the service provider's activities, and either report the Red Flags to the financial institution or creditor, or to take appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate identity theft.

                        <P>4. A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or customer, such as:</P>
                        <P>a. A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;</P>

                        <P>10. Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when compared against external information sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</P>
                        <P>a. The address does not match any address in the consumer report; or</P>
                        <P>b. The Social Security Number (SSN) has not been issued, or is listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.</P>

                        <P>12. Personal identifying information provided is associated with known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</P>
                        <P>a. The address on an application is the same as the address provided on a fraudulent application; or</P>
                        <P>b. The phone number on an application is the same as the number provided on a fraudulent application.</P>
                        <P>13. Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</P>
                        <P>a. The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a prison; or</P>
                        <P>b. The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or answering service.</P>

                        <P>15. The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of other persons opening accounts or by other customers.</P>

                        <P>17. Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with personal identifying information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor.</P>
                        <P>18. For financial institutions and creditors that use challenge questions, the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer report.</P>
                        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related to, the Covered Account</HD>
                        <P>19. Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered account, the institution or creditor receives a request for a new, additional, or replacement means of accessing the account or for the addition of an authorized user on the account.</P>
                        <P>20. A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:</P>
                        <P>a. Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;</P>
                        <P>b. A material increase in the use of available credit;</P>
                        <P>c. A material change in purchasing or spending patterns; or</P>

                        <P>21. A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).</P>
                        <P>
                            22. Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the customer's covered account.

                                1. For purposes of this Form, “foreign private issuer” shall be construed in accordance with Rule 405 under the Securities Act.

                            <P>2. For purposes of this Form, the term “crown corporation” shall mean a corporation all of whose common shares or comparable equity is owned directly or indirectly by the Government of Canada or a Province or Territory of Canada.</P>
                            <P>3. For purposes of this Form, the “public float” of specified securities shall mean only such securities held by persons other than affiliates of the issuer.</P>
                            <P>4. For the purposes of this Form, an “affiliate” of a person is anyone who beneficially owns directly or indirectly, or exercises control or direction over, more than 10 percent of the outstanding equity shares of such person. The determination of a person's affiliates shall be made as of the end of such person's most recently completed fiscal year.</P>

                            <P>6.

If there is no market for any of such securities, the book value of such securities computed as of the latest practicable date prior to the filing of this Form shall be used for purposes of calculating the market value, unless the issuer of such securities is in bankruptcy or receivership or has an accumulated capital deficit, in which case one-third of the principal amount, par value or stated value of such securities shall be used.</P>
                        </EXTRACT>
                        <P>(c) If the registrant is a successor registrant subsisting after a business combination, it shall be deemed to meet the 12-month reporting requirement of paragraph (b)(3) of this section if:</P>
                        <P>
                            (1) The time the successor registrant has been subject to the continuous disclosure requirements of any securities commission or equivalent regulatory authority in Canada, when added separately to the time each predecessor had been subject to such requirements at the time of the business combination, in each case equals at least 12 calendar months, 
                            <E T="03">provided, however,</E>
                             that any predecessor need not be considered for purposes of the reporting history calculation if the reporting histories of predecessors whose assets and gross revenues, respectively, would contribute at least 80 percent of the total assets and gross revenues from continuing operations of the successor registrant, as measured based on pro forma combination of such participating companies' most recently completed fiscal years immediately prior to the business combination, when combined with the reporting history of the successor registrant in each case satisfy such 12-month reporting requirement; and
                        </P>
                        <P>(2) The successor registrant has been subject to such continuous disclosure requirements since the business combination, and is currently in compliance with its obligations thereunder.</P>
                        <P>(d) This Form shall not be used if the registrant is an investment company registered or required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.</P>
                        <P>(e) Registrants registering securities on this Form, and registrants filing annual reports on this Form who have not previously filed a Form F-X (§ 249.250 of this chapter) in connection with the class of securities in relation to which the obligation to file this report arises, shall file a Form F-X with the Commission together with this Form.</P>

                        <P>(a) This form shall be used for filing a notice of withdrawal as broker-dealer pursuant to Rule 15b6-1 (§ 240.15b6-1 of this chapter), Rule 15Bc3-1 § 240.15B3-1 of this chapter), or Rule 15Cc1-1 (§ 240.15Cc1-1 of this chapter). Under sections 15(b), 15B, 15C, 17(a), and 23(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR part 240), and the rules and regulations thereunder, the Commission is authorized to solicit the information required to be supplied by this form from registrants desiring to withdraw their registration as a broker-dealer. Disclosure of the information specified in this form is mandatory prior to processing of applications for withdrawal, except for social security account numbers, disclosure of which is voluntary. The information will be used for the primary purpose of determining whether it is in the public interest to permit a broker-dealer to withdraw his registration. This notice will be made a matter of public record. Therefore, any information, given will be available for inspection by any member of the public. Because of the public nature of the information the Commission can utilize it for a variety of purposes, including referral to other governmental authorities or securities self-regulatory organizations for investigatory purposes or in connection with litigation involving the Federal securities laws and other civil, criminal or regulatory statutes or provisions. Social security account numbers, if furnished, will assist the Commission in identifying registrants and, therefore, in promptly processing applications for withdrawal. Failure to disclose the information requested by Form BDW, except for social security account numbers, may result in the registrant not being permitted to withdraw his registration.</P>
                        <P>(b) Interim Form BDW shall be used for application for registration as broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or to amend such application, only by order of the Commission. In the event broker-dealers are required to comply with their filing obligations on Interim Form BD, the form will be made available at the Commission's Publication Office at (202) 942-4040.</P>

                             This part is issued by the SEC under section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1851).

                             Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act establishes prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading and investments in or relationships with covered funds by certain banking entities, including registered broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, and registered security-based swap dealers, among others identified in section 2(12)(B) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. 5301(12)(B)). This part implements section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act by defining terms used in the statute and related terms, establishing prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading and investments in or relationships with covered funds, and explaining the statute's requirements.

                             This part implements section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act with respect to banking entities for which the SEC is the primary financial regulatory agency, as defined in this part, but does not include such entities to the extent they are not within the definition of banking entity in § 255.2(c).

                             Except as otherwise provided under section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the prohibitions and restrictions under section 13 of Bank Holding Company Act shall apply to the activities and investments of a banking entity identified in paragraph (c) of this section, even if such activities and investments are authorized for the banking entity under other applicable provisions of law.

                             Nothing in this part limits in any way the authority of the SEC to impose on a banking entity identified in paragraph (c) of this section additional requirements or restrictions with respect to any activity, investment, or relationship covered under section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act or this part, or additional penalties for violation of this part provided under any other applicable provision of law.

A banking entity may not rely on such information barriers if, in the case of any specific transaction, class or type of transactions or activity, the banking entity knows or should reasonably know that, notwithstanding the banking entity's establishment of information barriers, the conflict of interest may involve or result in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty.

                        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Purpose</HD>
                        <P>a. This appendix sets forth reporting and recordkeeping requirements that certain banking entities must satisfy in connection with the restrictions on proprietary trading set forth in subpart B (“proprietary trading restrictions”). Pursuant to § 255.20(d), this appendix applies to a banking entity that, together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, has significant trading assets and liabilities. These entities are required to (i) furnish periodic reports to the SEC regarding a variety of quantitative measurements of their covered trading activities, which vary depending on the scope and size of covered trading activities, and (ii) create and maintain records documenting the preparation and content of these reports. The requirements of this appendix must be incorporated into the banking entity's internal compliance program under § 255.20.</P>
                        <P>b. The purpose of this appendix is to assist banking entities and the SEC in:</P>
                        <P>(1) Better understanding and evaluating the scope, type, and profile of the banking entity's covered trading activities;</P>
                        <P>(2) Monitoring the banking entity's covered trading activities;</P>
                        <P>(3) Identifying covered trading activities that warrant further review or examination by the banking entity to verify compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions;</P>
                        <P>(4) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks engaged in market making-related activities subject to § 255.4(b) are consistent with the requirements governing permitted market making-related activities;</P>
                        <P>
                            (5) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks that are engaged in permitted trading activity subject to § 255.4, § 255.5, or § 255.6(a) and (b) (
                            <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                             underwriting and market making-related activity, risk-mitigating hedging, or trading in certain government obligations) are consistent with the requirement that such activity not result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies;
                        </P>
                        <P>(6) Identifying the profile of particular covered trading activities of the banking entity, and the individual trading desks of the banking entity, to help establish the appropriate frequency and scope of examination by SEC of such activities; and</P>
                        <P>(7) Assessing and addressing the risks associated with the banking entity's covered trading activities.</P>
                        <P>c. Information that must be furnished pursuant to this appendix is not intended to serve as a dispositive tool for the identification of permissible or impermissible activities.</P>
                        <P>d. In addition to the quantitative measurements required in this appendix, a banking entity may need to develop and implement other quantitative measurements in order to effectively monitor its covered trading activities for compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and to have an effective compliance program, as required by § 255.20. The effectiveness of particular quantitative measurements may differ based on the profile of the banking entity's businesses in general and, more specifically, of the particular trading desk, including types of instruments traded, trading activities and strategies, and history and experience (e.g., whether the trading desk is an established, successful market maker or a new entrant to a competitive market). In all cases, banking entities must ensure that they have robust measures in place to identify and monitor the risks taken in their trading activities, to ensure that the activities are within risk tolerances established by the banking entity, and to monitor and examine for compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions in this part.</P>
                        <P>
                            e. On an ongoing basis, banking entities must carefully monitor, review, and evaluate all furnished quantitative measurements, as well as any others that they choose to utilize in order to maintain compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part. All measurement results that indicate a heightened risk of impermissible proprietary trading, including with respect to otherwise-permitted activities under §§ 255.4 through 255.6(a) and (b), or that result in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies, must be escalated within the banking entity for review, further analysis, explanation to SEC, and remediation, where appropriate. The quantitative measurements discussed in this appendix should be helpful to banking entities in identifying

                            and managing the risks related to their covered trading activities.

                             For purposes of this appendix, Internal Limits are the constraints that define the amount of risk and the positions that a trading desk is permitted to take at a point in time, as defined by the banking entity for a specific trading desk. Usage represents the value of the trading desk's risk or positions that are accounted for by the current activity of the desk. Internal limits and their usage are key compliance and risk management tools used to control and monitor risk taking and include, but are not limited to, the limits set out in §§ 255.4 and 255.5. A trading desk's risk limits, commonly including a limit on “Value-at-Risk,” are useful in the broader context of the trading desk's overall activities, particularly for the market making activities under § 255.4(b) and hedging activity under § 255.5. Accordingly, the limits required under §§ 255.4(b)(2)(iii)(C) and 255.5(b)(1)(i)(A) must meet the applicable requirements under §§ 255.4(b)(2)(iii)(C) and 255.5(b)(1)(i)(A) and also must include appropriate metrics for the trading desk limits including, at a minimum, “Value-at-Risk” except to the extent the “Value-at-Risk” metric is demonstrably ineffective for measuring and monitoring the risks of a trading desk based on the types of positions traded by, and risk exposures of, that desk.

                             For purposes of this appendix, Comprehensive Profit and Loss Attribution is an analysis that attributes the daily fluctuation in the value of a trading desk's positions to various sources. First, the daily profit and loss of the aggregated positions is divided into two categories: (i) Profit and loss attributable to a trading desk's existing positions that were also positions held by the trading desk as of the end of the prior day (“existing positions”); and (ii) profit and loss attributable to new positions resulting from the current day's trading activity (“new positions”).

                            and loss from existing positions must be further attributed, as applicable, to (i) changes in the specific risk factors and other factors that are monitored and managed as part of the trading desk's overall risk management policies and procedures; and (ii) any other applicable elements, such as cash flows, carry, changes in reserves, and the correction, cancellation, or exercise of a trade.

                        <P>B. For the attribution of comprehensive profit and loss from existing positions to specific risk factors and other factors, a banking entity must provide the following information for the factors that explain the preponderance of the profit or loss changes due to risk factor changes: The unique identification label for the risk factor or other factor listed in the Risk Factor Attribution Information Schedule, and the profit or loss due to the risk factor or other factor change.</P>
                        <P>C. The comprehensive profit and loss attributed to new positions must reflect commissions and fee income or expense and market gains or losses associated with transactions executed on the applicable day. New positions include purchases and sales of financial instruments and other assets/liabilities and negotiated amendments to existing positions. The comprehensive profit and loss from new positions may be reported in the aggregate and does not need to be further attributed to specific sources.</P>
                        <P>D. The portion of comprehensive profit and loss from existing positions that is not attributed to changes in specific risk factors and other factors must be allocated to a residual category. Significant unexplained profit and loss must be escalated for further investigation and analysis.</P>

                             For purposes of this appendix, Transaction Volumes measures three exclusive categories of covered trading activity conducted by a trading desk. A banking entity is required to report the value and number of security and derivative transactions conducted by the trading desk with: (i) Customers, excluding internal transactions; (ii) non-customers, excluding internal transactions; and (iii) trading desks and other organizational units where the transaction is booked into either the same banking entity or an affiliated banking entity. For securities, value means gross market value. For derivatives, value means gross notional value. For purposes of calculating the Transaction Volumes quantitative measurement, do not include in the Transaction Volumes calculation for “securities” those securities that are also “derivatives,” as those terms are defined under subpart A; instead, report those securities that are also derivatives as “derivatives.”

Under sections 307, 308, 309, 310 and 319 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (17 CFR part 260), the Commission is authorized to solicit the information required to be supplied by this form for statements of eligibility and qualification of individuals designated to act as trustees. Disclosure of the information specified in this form is mandatory before processing statements of eligibility and qualification. The information will be used for the primary purpose of determining relationships of trustees and whether there are any conflicting interests. This statement will be made a matter of public record. Therefore, any information given will be available for inspection by any member of the public. Because of the public nature of the information, the Commission can utilize it for a variety of purposes, including referral to other governmental authorities or securities self-regulatory organizations for investigatory purposes or in connection with litigation involving the Federal securities laws or other civil, criminal or regulatory statutes or provisions. Failure to disclose the information requested by this form may result in enforcement action by the Commission to compel compliance with the Federal securities laws.</P>

Such issuer nonetheless is deemed to be an investment company for purposes of section 12(d)(1).

Issuers seeking the consent required by section 2(a)(51)(C) of the Act should note that section 2(a)(51)(C) requires an issuer to obtain the consent of the beneficial owners of its securities and the beneficial owners of securities of any “excepted investment company” that directly or indirectly owns the securities of the issuer. Except as set forth in paragraphs (d) (with respect to indirect owners) and (e) (with respect to direct owners) of this section, nothing in this section is designed to limit this consent requirement.</P>

However, if the absolute value of the change in net assets resulting from operations of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated is at least 10 percent lower than the average of the absolute value of such amounts for each of its last five fiscal years, then the registrant may compute both conditions of the income test using the average of the absolute value of such

                    <P>(ii) If the exchanged security was acquired through reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions, that security is deemed to have been sold with a sales load rate equal to the sales load rate previously paid on the security on which the dividend was paid or distribution made.</P>
                    <P>(c) If either no sales load is imposed on the acquired security or the sales load imposed is less than the maximum allowed by paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the offering company may require the exchanging securityholder to have held the exchanged security for a minimum period of time previously established by the offering company and applied uniformly to all securityholders of the class specified.</P>
                    <P>(d) Any offering company that has previously made an offer of exchange may continue to impose fees or sales loads permitted by an order under section 11(a) of the Act upon shares purchased before the earlier of (1) One year after the effective date of this section, or (2) When the offer has been brought into compliance with the terms of this section, and upon shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions based on such shares, until such shares are redeemed.</P>

                    <P>(1) The offering company's prospectus disclosed, during at least the two year period prior to the amendment of the offer (or, if the fund is less than two years old, at all times the offer has been outstanding) that the terms of the offer were subject to change, or</P>
                    <P>(2) The only effect of such change is to reduce or eliminate an administrative fee, sales load or redemption fee payable at the time of an exchange.</P>

If the fund remains out of compliance with the applicable VaR test at that time, the derivatives risk manager's written report must update the report previously provided under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section and the derivatives risk manager must update the board of directors on the fund's progress in coming back into compliance at regularly

                         On or before the implementation of the program, and at least annually thereafter, the derivatives risk manager must provide to the board of directors a written report providing a representation that the program is reasonably designed to manage the fund's derivatives risks and to incorporate the elements provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section. The representation may be based on the derivatives risk manager's reasonable belief after due inquiry. The written report must include the basis for the representation along with such information as may be reasonably necessary to evaluate the adequacy of the fund's program and, for reports following the program's initial implementation, the effectiveness of its implementation. The written report also must include, as applicable, the derivatives risk manager's basis for the approval of any designated reference portfolio or any change in the designated reference portfolio during the period covered by the report; or an explanation of the basis for the derivatives risk manager's determination that a designated reference portfolio would not provide an appropriate reference portfolio for purposes of the relative VaR test.

                    <P>(c) Accumulated undistributed net income and accumulated undistributed net profits from the sale of securities or other properties shall be determined, at the option of the company, either (1) from the date of the organization of the company, (2) from the date of a reorganization, as defined in clause (A) or (B) of section 2(a)(33) of the Act (54 Stat. 790; 15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(33)), (3) from the date as of which a write-down of portfolio securities was made in connection with a corporate readjustment, approved by stockholders, of the type known as “quasi- reorganization,” or (4) from January 1, 1925, to the close of the period as of which the dividend is paid, without giving effect to such payment.</P>
                    <P>(d) For the purpose of this section, open-end companies which upon the sale of their shares allocate to undistributed income or other similar account that portion of the consideration received which represents the approximate per share amount of undistributed net income included in the sales price, and make a corresponding deduction from undistributed net income upon the purchase or redemption of shares, need not treat the amounts so allocated as paid-in surplus or other capital source.</P>
                    <P>(e) For the purpose of this section, the source or sources from which a dividend is paid shall be determined (or reasonably estimated) to the close of the period as of which it is paid without giving effect to such payment. If any such estimate is subsequently ascertained to be inaccurate in a significant amount, a correction thereof shall be made by a written statement pursuant to section 19(a) of the Act or in the first report to stockholders following discovery of the inaccuracy.</P>
                    <P>(f) Insofar as a written statement made pursuant to section 19(a) of the Act relates to a dividend on preferred stock paid for a period of less than a year, a company may elect to indicate only that portion of the payment which is made from sources specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and need not specify the sources from which the remainder was paid. Every company which in any fiscal year elects to make a statement pursuant to the preceding sentence shall transmit to the holders of such preferred stock, at a date reasonably near the end of the last dividend period in such fiscal year, a statement meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section on an annual basis.</P>
                    <P>(g) The purpose of this section, in the light of which it shall be construed, is to afford security holders adequate disclosure of the sources from which dividend payments are made. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the inclusion in any written statement of additional information in explanation of the information required by this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a dividend payment in violation of any State law or to prevent compliance with any requirement of State law regarding dividends consistent with this rule.</P>

                    </P>
                    <P>(1) The capital gain distribution is a result of—</P>
                    <P>(i) An issuer's calling or redeeming an eligible trust security held by the Trust,</P>
                    <P>(ii) The sale of an eligible trust security by the Trust to provide funds for redemption of Trust units when the amount received by the Trust for such sale exceeds the amount required to satisfy the redemption distribution,</P>
                    <P>(iii) The sale of an eligible trust security to maintain qualification of the Trust as a “regulated investment company” under section 851 of the Code,</P>

                    <P>(e) If a registered investment company because of unforeseen circumstances in a particular taxable year proposes to make a distribution which would be prohibited by the provisions of this section, it may file a request with the Commission for authorization to make such a distribution. Such request shall comply with the requirements of § 270.0-2 of this chapter and shall set forth the pertinent facts and explain the circumstances which the company believes justify such distribution. The request shall be deemed granted unless the Commission within 15 days after receipt thereof shall deny such request as not being necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and notify the company in writing of such denial.</P>
                    <P>(f) A registered investment company may make one additional distribution of long-term capital gains, as defined in the Code, with respect to any one taxable year of the company, which distribution is made, in whole or in part, for the purpose of not incurring any tax under section 4982 of the Code. Such additional distribution may be made prior or subsequent to any distribution otherwise permitted by paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

                    <P>(1) This paragraph shall not prevent a sponsor of a unit investment trust (hereinafter referred to as the “Trust”) engaged exclusively in the business of investing in eligible trust securities (as defined in Rule 14a-3(b) (17 CFR 270.14a-3(b))) from selling or repurchasing Trust units in a secondary market at a price based on the offering side evaluation of the eligible trust securities in the Trust's portfolio, determined at any time on the last business day of each week, effective for all sales made during the following week, if on the days that such sales or repurchases are made the sponsor receives a letter from a qualified evaluator stating, in its opinion, that:</P>
                    <P>(i) In the case of repurchases, the current bid price is not higher than the offering side evaluation, computed on the last business day of the previous week; and</P>

                    <P>
                        (2) This paragraph shall not prevent any registered investment company from adjusting the price of its redeemable securities sold pursuant to a merger, consolidation or purchase of substantially all of the assets of a company which meets the conditions specified in § 270.17a-8.

                    <P>(3) Notwithstanding this paragraph (a), a registered open-end management investment company (but not a registered open-end management investment company that is regulated as a money market fund under § 270.2a-7 or an exchange-traded fund as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section) (a “fund”) may use swing pricing to adjust its current net asset value per share to mitigate dilution of the value of its outstanding redeemable securities as a result of shareholder purchase or redemption activity, provided that it has established and implemented swing pricing policies and procedures in compliance with the paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (v) of this section.</P>
                    <P>(i) The fund's swing pricing policies and procedures must:</P>
                    <P>(A) Provide that the fund must adjust its net asset value per share by a single swing factor or multiple factors that may vary based on the swing threshold(s) crossed once the level of net purchases into or net redemptions from such fund has exceeded the applicable swing threshold for the fund. In determining whether the fund's level of net purchases or net redemptions has exceeded the applicable swing threshold(s), the person(s) responsible for administering swing pricing shall be permitted to make such determination based on receipt of sufficient information about the fund investors' daily purchase and redemption activity (“investor flow”) to allow the fund to reasonably estimate whether it has crossed the swing threshold(s) with high confidence, and shall exclude any purchases or redemptions that are made in kind and not in cash. This investor flow information may consist of individual, aggregated, or netted orders, and may include reasonable estimates where necessary.</P>
                    <P>(B) Specify the process for how the fund's swing threshold(s) shall be determined, considering:</P>
                    <P>
                        <E T="03">(1)</E>
                         The size, frequency, and volatility of historical net purchases or net redemptions of fund shares during normal and stressed periods;

                    <P>
                        <E T="03">(2)</E>
                         The fund's investment strategy and the liquidity of the fund's portfolio investments;
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        <E T="03">(3)</E>
                         The fund's holdings of cash and cash equivalents, and borrowing arrangements and other funding sources; and

                    </P>
                    <P>(C) Specify the process for how the swing factor(s) shall be determined, which must include: The establishment of an upper limit on the swing factor(s) used, which may not exceed two percent of net asset value per share; and the determination that the factor(s) used are reasonable in relationship to the costs discussed in this paragraph. In determining the swing factor(s) and the upper limit, the person(s) responsible for administering swing pricing may take into account only the near-term costs expected to be incurred by the fund as a result of net purchases or net redemptions that occur on the day the swing factor(s) is used, including spread costs, transaction fees and charges arising from asset purchases or asset sales resulting from those purchases or redemptions, and borrowing-related costs associated with satisfying redemptions.</P>
                    <P>(ii) The fund's board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the fund must:</P>
                    <P>(A) Approve the fund's swing pricing policies and procedures;</P>
                    <P>(B) Approve the fund's swing threshold(s) and the upper limit on the swing factor(s) used, and any changes to the swing threshold(s) or the upper limit on the swing factor(s) used;</P>
                    <P>(C) Designate the fund's investment adviser, officer, or officers responsible for administering the swing pricing policies and procedures (“person(s) responsible for administering swing pricing”). The administration of swing pricing must be reasonably segregated from portfolio management of the fund and may not include portfolio managers; and</P>
                    <P>(D) Review, no less frequently than annually, a written report prepared by the person(s) responsible for administering swing pricing that describes:</P>

                    </P>

                    <P>(A) The fund may generally classify and review its portfolio investments (including the fund's derivatives transactions) according to their asset class, provided, however, that the fund must separately classify and review any investment within an asset class if the fund or its adviser has information about any market, trading, or investment-specific considerations that are reasonably expected to significantly affect the liquidity characteristics of that investment as compared to the fund's other portfolio holdings within that asset class.</P>
                    <P>(B) In classifying and reviewing its portfolio investments or asset classes (as applicable), the fund must determine whether trading varying portions of a position in a particular portfolio investment or asset class, in sizes that the fund would reasonably anticipate trading, is reasonably expected to significantly affect its liquidity, and if so, the fund must take this determination into account when classifying the liquidity of that investment or asset class.</P>
                    <P>(C) For derivatives transactions that the fund has classified as moderately liquid investments, less liquid investments, and illiquid investments, identify the percentage of the fund's highly liquid investments that it has pledged as margin or collateral in connection with derivatives transactions in each of these classification categories.</P>

                    <P>(a) A registered closed-end company may purchase for cash a security of which it is the issuer, subject to the following conditions:</P>
                    <P>(1) If the security is a stock entitled to cumulative dividends, such dividends are not in arrears.</P>
                    <P>(2) If the security is a stock not entitled to cumulative dividends, at least 90 percent of the net income of the issuer for the last preceding fiscal year, determined in accordance with good accounting practice and not including profits or losses realized from the sale of securities or other properties, was distributed to its shareholders during such fiscal year or within 60 days after the close of such fiscal year.</P>
                    <P>(3) If the security to be purchased is junior to any class of outstanding security of the issuer representing indebtedness (except notes or other evidences of indebtedness held by a bank or other person, the issuance of which did not involve a public offering) all securities of such class shall have an asset coverage of at least 300 percent immediately after such purchase; and if the security to be purchased is junior to any class of outstanding senior security of the issuer which is a stock, all securities of such class shall have an asset coverage of at least 200 percent immediately after such purchase, and shall not be in arrears as to dividends.</P>
                    <P>(4) The seller of the security is not to the knowledge of the issuer an affiliated person of the issuer.</P>
                    <P>(5) Payment of the purchase price is accompanied or preceded by a written confirmation of the purchase.</P>
                    <P>(6) The purchase is made at a price not above the market value, if any, or the asset value of such security, whichever is lower, at the time of such purchase.</P>
                    <P>(7) The issuer discloses to the seller or, if the seller is acting through a broker, to the seller's broker, either prior to or at the time of purchase the approximate or estimated asset coverage per unit of the security to be purchased.</P>
                    <P>(8) No brokerage commission is paid by the issuer to any affiliated person of the issuer in connection with the purchase.</P>
                    <P>(9) The purchase is not made in a manner or on a basis which discriminates unfairly against any holders of the class of securities purchased.</P>
                    <P>(10) If the security is a stock, the issuer has, within the preceding six months, informed stockholders of its intention to purchase stock of such class by letter or report addressed to all the stockholders of such class.</P>
                    <P>(11) The issuer files with the Commission, as an exhibit to Form N-CSR (§ 249.331 and § 274.128), a copy of any written solicitation to purchase securities under this section sent or given during the period covered by the report by or on behalf of the issuer to 10 or more persons.</P>
                    <P>(b) Notwithstanding the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section, a closed-end company may purchase fractional interests in, or fractional rights to receive, any security of which it is the issuer.</P>
                    <P>(c) This rule does not apply to purchase of securities made pursuant to section 23(c)(1) or (2) of the Act (54 Stat. 825; 15 U.S.C. 80a-23). A registered closed-end company may file an application with the Commission for an order under section 23(c)(3) of the Act permitting the purchase of any security of which it is the issuer which does not meet the conditions of this rule and which is not to be made pursuant to section 23(c)(1) or (2) of the Act.</P>
                    <P>(d) This rule relates exclusively to the requirements of section 23(c) of the Act, and the provisions hereof shall not be construed to authorize any action which contravenes any other applicable law, statutory or otherwise, or the provision of any indenture or other instrument pursuant to which securities of the issuer were issued.</P>

                    <P>(h) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a depositor or principal underwriter, acting as such for two or more registered investment companies issuing periodic payment plan certificates, from combining in a single segregated trust account the reserves for such companies required by this section.</P>
                    <P>(i) The refunds required to be made to certificate holders pursuant to sections 27(d) and 27(f) (of the Act) shall be paid in cash not more than 7 days from the date the certificate is received in proper form by the custodian bank or such other paying agent as may be designated under the periodic payment plan.</P>

                        <E T="03">Eligibility for exemption.</E>
                         If you are registered or are registering with the Commission as an investment adviser and submit electronic filings on the Investment Adviser Registration Depository (IARD) system, but have unanticipated technical difficulties that prevent you from submitting a filing to the IARD system, you may request a temporary hardship exemption from the requirements of this chapter to file electronically.

                         To request a temporary hardship exemption, you must:
                    </P>
                    <P>(i) File Form ADV-H (17 CFR 279.3) in paper format with no later than one business day after the filing that is the subject of the ADV-H was due; and</P>

                         The temporary hardship exemption will be granted when you file a completed Form ADV-H.

                        <E T="03">Eligibility for exemption.</E>
                         If you are a “small business” (as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section), you may apply for a continuing hardship exemption.
                    </P>
                    <P>The period of the exemption may be no longer than one year after the date on which you apply for the exemption.</P>

                        (2) 
                        <E T="03">Application procedures.</E>
                         To apply for a continuing hardship exemption, you must file Form ADV-H at least ten business days before a filing is due. The Commission will grant or deny your application within ten business days after you file Form ADV-H.

                         You are not exempt from the electronic filing requirements until and unless the Commission approves your application. If the Commission approves your application, you may submit your filings to FINRA in paper format for the period 
                        <PRTPAGE P="506"/>
                        of time for which the exemption is granted.

                         Your application will be granted only if you are able to demonstrate that the electronic filing requirements of this chapter are prohibitively burdensome or expensive.

                         You are a “small business” for purposes of this section if you are required to answer Item 12 of Form ADV (17 CFR 279.1) and checked “no” to each question in Item 12 that you were required to answer.

You are not required to file with the Commission amendments to brochure supplements required by Part 2B of Form ADV.
                    </P>
                    <P>(2) If you have received a continuing hardship exemption under § 275.203-3, you must, when you are required to amend your Form ADV, file a completed Part 1A, Part 2A and Part 3 of Form ADV on paper with the SEC by mailing it to FINRA.</P>

                        pay the initial filing fee, you must pay an annual filing fee each time you file your annual updating amendment. No portion of either fee is refundable.

Your initial report on Form PF is due no later than the last day on which your next update would be timely in accordance with paragraph (e) if you had previously filed the Form; provided that you are not required to file Form PF with respect to any fiscal quarter or fiscal year ending prior to the date on which your registration becomes effective.

                    </P>
                    <P>(c) This rule shall not be construed as relieving in any way the investment adviser or another person relying on this rule from acting in the best interests of the advisory client, including fulfilling the duty with respect to the best price and execution for the particular transaction for the advisory client; nor shall it relieve such person or persons from any disclosure obligation which may be imposed by subparagraphs (1) or (2) of section 206 of the Act or by other applicable provisions of the federal securities laws.</P>

If you send account statements to a client to which you are required to provide this notice, include in the notification provided to that client and in any subsequent account statement you send that client a statement urging the client to compare the account statements from the custodian with those from the adviser.

                         You have a reasonable basis, after due inquiry, for believing that the qualified custodian sends an account statement, at least quarterly, to each of your clients for which it maintains funds or securities, identifying the amount of funds and of each security in the account at the end of the period and setting forth all transactions in the account during that period.

The written agreement must provide for the first examination to occur within six months of becoming subject to this paragraph, except that, if you maintain client funds or securities pursuant to this section as a qualified custodian, the agreement must provide for the first examination to occur no later than six months after obtaining the internal control report.

                        <P>(1) Arises from a transaction in which a customer (as defined in § 300.300) of the other broker or dealer had an interest. For the purposes of this rule a customer is deemed to have an interest in a transaction if (i) the other broker was acting as agent for the customer or (ii) the other dealer was not a market maker in the security involved, to the extent such other dealer held a firm order from the customer and in connection therewith: In the case of a buy order, prior to executing such customer's order purchased as principal the same number of shares or purchased shares to accumulate the number of shares necessary to complete the order; or in the case of a sell order, prior to executing such customer's order sold the same number of shares or a portion thereof; and</P>
                        <P>(2)(i) Had a settlement date on or within 30 calendar days prior to the filing date and the respective obligations of the parties remained outstanding on the filing date or had a settlement date which occurs on or within three business days subsequent to the filing date; and</P>

                        <P>
                            (1) In the case of a broker or dealer who maintains his records on a specific identification basis:

                        <P>(ii) In the case of a failed to deliver of the debtor, as of the filing date such broker's or dealer's customer's interest had not been sold to such broker or dealer; or</P>
                        <P>(2) In the case of a broker or dealer who maintains his records other than on a specific identification basis, he has determined that a customer had such an interest in a manner consistent with that used by such broker or dealer prior to the filing date to allocate fails to receive and fails to deliver in computing the special reserve bank account requirement pursuant to the provisions of Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR 240.15c3-3); or</P>
                        <P>(3) In the case of a broker or dealer not described in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, he has made the determination in a manner which the trustee finds to be fair and equitable.</P>

                        <P>(2) At the option of the trustee by the delivery of securities against receipt of the contract price or payment of the contract price against the receipt of the securities at any time within 30 calendar days after settlement date unless the commitment previously has been bought-in or sold-out in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or</P>
                        <P>(3) In the event of the refusal of the other broker or dealer to accept completion of an open contractual commitment in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or the failure of the other broker or dealer to promptly buy-in or sell-out a commitment in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or in the event of the failure of the other broker or dealer to provide the trustee with appropriate documentation as required by § 300.303, by delivery of securities against receipt of the contract price or payment of the contract price against receipt of securities, or the buy-in or sell-out of the commitment or cancellation of the commitment or otherwise, as may be appropriate, as the trustee in his discretion will most benefit the estate of the debtor.</P>

                        <P>
                            (b) As promptly as practicable after the initiation of a liquidation proceeding or a direct payment procedure under the Act, the trustee in a liquidation proceeding, or SIPC in a direct payment procedure, shall liquidate or

                        </P>
                        <P>(c) A trustee in a liquidation proceeding, or SIPC in a direct payment procedure, shall calculate the dollar amount of all Standardized Options positions held for the account of a customer in accordance with section 16(11) of the Act, and credit or debit, as appropriate, the dollar amount so calculated to the account of such customer.</P>

Any such positions that are not liquidated shall be excluded from the calculation provided for in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                        <P>(e) In no event will Standardized Options positions be delivered to or on behalf of customers in satisfaction of claims pursuant to section 7(b)(1) of the Act except to the extent that such positions have been transferred as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                        <P>(f) In no event will Standardized Options be purchased for delivery to customers pursuant to section 8(d) of the Act.</P>
                        <P>(g) This rule shall not be construed as limiting or restricting in any way the exercise of any right of a broker or registered clearing agency to liquidate or cause the liquidation of Standardized Options Positions.</P>

                    <P>(d) In connection with customer accounts transferred to the bridge broker or dealer pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, claims for net equity shall not be transferred but shall remain with the covered broker or dealer. Customer property transferred from the covered broker or dealer, along with advances from SIPC, shall be allocated to customer accounts at the bridge broker or dealer in accordance with § 302.104(a)(3). Such allocations initially may be based upon estimates, and such estimates may be based upon the books and records of the covered broker or dealer or any other information deemed relevant in the discretion of the Corporation, as receiver, in consultation with SIPC, as trustee. Such estimates may be adjusted from time to time as additional information becomes available. With respect to each account transferred to the bridge broker or dealer pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the bridge broker or dealer shall undertake the obligations of a broker or dealer only with respect to property transferred to and held by the bridge broker or dealer, and allocated to the account as provided in § 302.104(a)(3), including any customer property and any advances from SIPC. The bridge broker or dealer shall have no obligations with respect to any customer property or other property that is not transferred from the covered broker or dealer to the bridge broker or dealer. The transfer of customer property to such an account shall have no effect on calculation of the amount of the affected accountholder's net equity, but the value, as of the appointment date, of the customer property and advances from SIPC so transferred shall be deemed to satisfy any such claim, in whole or in part.</P>
                    <P>(e) The transfer of assets or liabilities held by a covered broker or dealer, including customer accounts and all associated customer name securities and customer property, assets and liabilities held by a covered broker or dealer for any non-customer creditor, and assets and liabilities associated with any trust or custody business, to a bridge broker or dealer, shall be effective without any consent, authorization, or approval of any person or entity, including but not limited to, any customer, contract party, governmental authority, or court.</P>

                    <P>(3) Succeed to any and all registrations and memberships of the covered broker or dealer with or in any self-regulatory organizations.</P>
                    <P>(g) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the bridge broker or dealer shall be subject to applicable Federal securities laws and all requirements with respect to being a member of a self-regulatory organization and shall operate in accordance with all such laws and requirements and in accordance with its articles of association; provided, however, that the Commission may, in its discretion, exempt the bridge broker or dealer from any such requirements if the Commission deems such exemption to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</P>
                    <P>(h) At the end of the term of existence of a bridge broker or dealer, any proceeds that remain after payment of all administrative expenses of such bridge broker or dealer and all other claims against such bridge broker or dealer shall be distributed to the receiver for the related covered broker or dealer.</P>

The allocation of customer property, advances from SIPC, and delivery of customer name securities to each customer or to its customer account at a bridge broker or dealer, in partial or complete satisfaction of such customer's net equity claims as of the close of business on the appointment date, shall be in a manner, including form and timing, and in an amount at least as beneficial to such customer as would have been the case had the covered broker or dealer been liquidated under SIPA. Any claims related to determinations made by SIPC as trustee for a covered broker or dealer shall be governed by the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

The claims bar date for a covered broker or dealer shall be the date following the expiration of the six-month period beginning on the date a notice to creditors to file their claims is first published in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(2)(B)(i) and any regulations promulgated thereunder. Any claim filed after the claims bar date shall be disallowed, and such disallowance shall be final, as provided by 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(3)(C)(i) and any regulations promulgated thereunder, except that a claim filed after the claims bar date shall be considered by the receiver as provided by 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(3)(C)(ii) and any regulations promulgated thereunder. In accordance with section 8(a)(3) of SIPA, 15 U.S.C. 78fff-2(a)(3), any claim for net equity filed more than sixty days after the date the notice to creditors to file claims is first published need not be paid or satisfied in whole or in part out of customer property and, to the extent such claim is paid by funds advanced by SIPC, it shall be satisfied in cash or securities, or both, as SIPC, as trustee, determines is most economical to the receivership estate.

                             Section 15C(a)(4) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-5(a)(4)) authorizes the Secretary to exempt any government securities broker or dealer or class thereof, conditionally or unconditionally, from the requirements of registration or regulations promulgated under section 15C.

                        <P>(3) All requests for exemptions and classifications, and all requests for binding interpretations, shall be in writing, and shall conform to the following procedures.</P>
                        <P>(i) The names of the company or companies and all other persons involved shall be stated. Letters pertaining to unnamed companies or persons or hypothetical situations will not be answered.</P>
                        <P>(ii) The letter must contain a concise but complete statement of all material facts, a complete and accurate description of the entire transaction if the request is transactional (even though a request may apply to only a portion of a transaction), and a concise and unambiguous statement of the request, including precise statutory and regulatory citations.</P>
                        <P>(iii) The letter shall indicate why the writer believes a problem exists or interpretation is needed, the writer's opinion on the matter, and the basis for such opinion.</P>
                        <P>(iv) In addition to requests for confidential treatment under paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, a person may request confidential treatment of information that is submitted as part of, or in support of, a request for interpretation, exemption, or classification. A separate request for confidential treatment and the basis for such request shall be submitted at the time the information for which confidential treatment is requested is submitted. The request for confidential treatment must specifically identify the information for which such confidential treatment is requested. To the extent practicable, the information should be segregated from information for which confidential treatment is not requested and should be clearly marked as confidential.</P>
                        <P>(v) Information designated as confidential in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section shall not be disclosed to a person requesting such information other than in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Department's regulations published at 31 CFR 1.6.</P>

                        </P>
                        <P>(4) A written response by the Department to a request filed as stated in paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall be binding, with respect to the requester, on the Department, but shall cease to be binding if the facts are not as stated in the request or, prospectively, if the Department issues a superseding interpretation. In responding to such a request, the Department will, where appropriate, consult with and may obtain the formal concurrence of the appropriate regulatory agencies or their staffs. The Department understands that even if formal concurrence is not received the appropriate regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations will give appropriate deference to binding interpretations of the Department. The Department also expects the SEC staff to reflect such interpretations in responding, pursuant to the established procedures of the Commission, to no-action requests concerning rules the SEC enforces.</P>
                        <P>(5) The Department may decline to issue an interpretation for any reason and, in particular, may require that a requester make inquiry of its appropriate regulatory agency, the Commission or designated examining authority before the Department responds to a request.</P>
                        <P>(6) The Department will also provide informal oral and written advice, but such advice is not binding on the Department or on any other agency or organization.</P>
                        <P>(7)(i) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iv) and (c)(7)(ii) of this section, every letter or other written communication requesting the Department to provide interpretive legal advice under the Act or to grant, deny or modify an exemption, classification or modification of the regulations, together with any written response thereto, shall be made available for inspection and copying as soon as practicable after the response has been sent or given to the person requesting it. These documents will be made available at the following location: Treasury Department Library, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Annex, Room 1020, Washington, DC 20220.</P>
                        <P>(ii) Any person submitting a letter or communication may also simultaneously submit a request that the letter or communication and the Department's response be accorded confidential treatment for a specified period of time not to exceed 120 days from the date the response has been made or given to such person. The request shall state the basis upon which the request for confidential treatment has been made. If the Department determines that the request for confidential treatment should be denied, the requester will be given 30 days to withdraw either the request for confidential treatment or the letter or communication requesting an interpretation, classification, or exemption.</P>
                        <P>
                            (d) 
                            <E T="03">Effect of Commission interpretations.</E>
                             Interpretations of the Commission and its staff (including no-action positions) and of the designated examining authorities, of any Commission regulation expressly adopted by reference in these regulations shall be of the same effect as if the regulation being interpreted were solely the Commission's regulation. However, in the event the Treasury has issued a formal interpretation on the subject, the Treasury understands that the Commission will give that interpretation appropriate deference, particularly with respect to both subsequent no-action positions and the continued validity of prior no-action positions.

                        <P>The market risk haircut is the sum of the Treasury market risk haircut and the other securities haircut, calculated as follows.</P>

                             The “Treasury market risk haircut” equals the sum of the total governments offset portion haircut, the total futures and options offset haircut, the total hedging disallowance haircut, and the residual net position haircut, calculated with respect to financings and positions in Treasury market risk instruments, except to the extent that a permissible election is made pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section to include qualified positions in the calculation of the other securities haircut.

                             The “total governments offset portion haircut” equals the sum of the governments offset portion haircuts calculated for each category in § 402.2(f)(1). The “governments offset portion haircuts” equal, for each category in § 402.2(f)(1), the product of the offset haircut factor for that category set out in § 402.2(f)(2) and the smaller of the absolute values of the gross long immediate position or gross short immediate position for that category. Schedules B and C in paragraph (c) of this section can be used to make this calculation.

                        <P>(B) In the case of category MB, the “gross short immediate position” equals the sum of the market values of all short immediate positions in fixed rate mortgage-backed securities which are Treasury market risk instruments.</P>
                        <P>(C) In the case of category AR, the “gross short immediate position” equals the sum of the market values of all short immediate positions in adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities which are Treasury market risk instruments.</P>

                                Schedules A through E may be used by government securities brokers or dealers subject to 17 CFR 402 to determine the firm's capital-to-risk ratio. Section 402.2 provides that a government securities broker or dealer must meet the applicable minimum dollar liquid capital requirement and that the firm's ratio of liquid capital to risk (total haircuts) must be at least 1.2:1; liquid capital must exceed risk by at least 20 percent. Total haircuts is the risk measure used in the ratio; it is made up of measures of market risk and measures of credit risk. The market risk of a government securities broker's or dealer's positions is accounted for 
                                <PRTPAGE P="604"/>
                                through the Treasury market risk haircut and the other securities haircut. Credit risk is accounted for in the counterparty exposure, concentration of credit, and credit volatility haircuts and in the computation of liquid capital through the various deductions and charges.
                            </P>
                            <P>Only positions in Treasury market risk instruments and financings may be used in the calculation of the Treasury market risk haircut. Treasury market risk instruments and financings are described in 17 CFR 402.2 and in the instructions to the schedule where they are to be first entered. All other types of financial instruments are to be included in the calculation of the other securities haircut. Calculation of the other securities haircut is based on the SEC's Rule 15c3-1 (17 CFR 240.15c3-1).</P>
                            <P>Treasury market risk instruments may be excluded from the calculation of the Treasury market risk haircut if they are included in the calculation of the other securities haircut as part of a hedge against long and short positions in securities, futures contracts, forward contracts, or options that are not Treasury market risk instruments. Only the portion of the total position in a Treasury market risk instrument that forms part of such a hedge may be excluded, and the result of this transfer of the Treasury market risk instruments must be a reduction in the other securities haircut.</P>
                            <P>The categories for classifying Treasury market risk instruments are designated in 17 CFR 402.2(f)(1). The categories, which are designated by a maturity range, contain all securities with remaining terms to maturity greater than or equal to the lower end of the range but less than the higher. A half year is always considered to be 6 months. In categories A through D, zero-coupon instruments are to be treated in the same manner as all other instruments. In categories E through J, the maturity designations in parentheses give the maturities of the zero-coupon instruments to be placed in that category. All mortgage-backed securities that are Treasury market risk instruments are to be placed in category MB or category AR, depending on whether they are backed by conventional or adjustable-rate mortgages.</P>
                            <P>All haircuts may be calculated to the nearest hundred dollars, unless such rounding would materially affect the liquid capital calculation.</P>
                            <P>Appendix A to the Preamble published with the temporary regulations for 17 CFR part 402 (52 FR 19669, May 26, 1987) contains an example of the capital calculation. It may also be used as an aid in completing these schedules.</P>

The other securities haircut is the sum of all applicable deductions as specified in 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 (c)(2)(vi) and (c)(2)(viii) and in 17 CFR 240.15c3-1a and 240.15c3-1b. Any position(s) in Treasury market risk instruments that have been excluded from the calculation of the Treasury market risk haircut because they are part of a hedge with these other instruments are to be included in the calculation of this haircut.</P>

                            <P>a. Enter the total counterparty exposure haircut which is the sum of the counterparty exposure haircut with each counterparty, except a Federal Reserve Bank. A counterparty exposure haircut is equal to 5 percent of the net credit exposure to a single counterparty which is not in excess of 15 percent of the government securities broker's or dealer's liquid capital. If the net credit exposure to a counterparty does exceed 15 percent of liquid capital, the excess will be used in calculating the total concentration of credit haircut on line 3b.</P>

                                Net credit exposure equals the difference between the government securities broker's or dealer's credit exposure to a single counterparty and that counterparty's credit exposure to the government securities broker or dealer. The government securities broker's or dealer's credit exposure to a counterparty is equal to the sum of the dollar amount of funds, debt instruments, other securities, and other inventory at risk to the government securities broker or dealer in the event of the counterparty's default and the market value of purchased unlisted options that are Treasury market risk instruments and were written by the counterparty.

                            <P>The counterparty's credit exposure to the government securities broker or dealer equals the dollar amount of funds, debt instruments, other securities, and other inventory at risk to the counterparty in the event of the government security broker's or dealer's default and any unlisted options written by the government securities broker or dealer and held by the counterparty.</P>
                            <P>b. Enter the total concentration of credit haircut which is the sum of all concentration of credit haircuts applied in cases where the net credit exposure (as defined above) to a single counterparty is in excess of 15 percent of the government securities broker's or dealer's liquid capital. The concentration of credit haircut is 25 percent of the amount of net credit exposure in excess of 15 percent of the government securities broker's or dealer's liquid capital.</P>
                            <P>c. Enter the credit volatility haircut which equals a factor of 0.15 percent applied to the larger of the gross long or gross short position in money market instruments qualifying as Treasury market risk instruments which mature in 45 days or more, in futures and forwards on these instruments that are settled on a cash or delivery basis, and in futures and forwards on time deposits described in § 402.2(e)(1)(vii), that mature in 45 days or more, settled on a cash or delivery basis. Money market instruments qualifying as Treasury market risk instruments are (1) marketable certificates of deposit with no more than one year to maturity, (2) bankers acceptances, and (3) commercial paper of no more than one year to maturity and which has only a minimal amount of credit risk as determined by the government securities broker or dealer pursuant to reasonably designed written policies and procedures the government securities broker or government securities dealer establishes, maintains, and enforces to assess and monitor creditworthiness. These policies and procedures should result in creditworthiness assessments that typically are consistent with market data.</P>
                            <P>Line 4—Enter total haircuts which is the sum of lines 2 a through e, and 3 a, b, and c.</P>
                            <P>Line 5—Enter the capital-to-risk ratio which is found by dividing line 1, “Liquid capital,” by line 4, “Total haircuts.” The capital-to-risk ratio must be at least equal to 1.2:1.</P>

                            <P>Schedule B is used to calculate the net immediate position in and offset portion of securities and financings. The results are then carried over to Schedule C for initial haircut calculations. Futures, forwards, and options which are Treasury market risk instruments are to be entered on Schedule D.</P>
                            <P>Positions in and financings on debt instruments other than mortgage-backed or adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities should be placed in the category corresponding to their remaining term to maturity. In the case of a floating rate note, however, the note should be placed in the category corresponding to the time to the next scheduled interest rate adjustment or remaining term to maturity, whichever is less.</P>
                            <P>Column 1—Under “Financings-Long” report in the appropriate category the contract value of reverse repurchase agreements and the value(s) of cash collateral on security borrowings.

Include repurchase agreements, securities lending secured by cash collateral, and term financings, but exclude subordinated debt which meets the requirements of 17 CFR 240.15c3-1d as modified by 17 CFR 402.2d. Financings so reported should be placed in the category corresponding to the remaining term to maturity or time to the next scheduled interest rate adjustment, whichever is less.</P>

Note that in the case of an option on a futures contract the category in which the option contract is to be entered is the sum of the remaining time to maturity of the futures or forward contract and the maturity of the instrument underlying the futures or forward contract. The haircut factor used to determine the gross futures interim haircut is that factor corresponding to the term to maturity of the deliverable security at the time of the maturity of the futures or forward contract.

                            <P>Schedule E is used to calculate the hedging disallowance and residual net position haircuts which are then carried to Schedule A. The purpose of Schedule E is to hedge positions in different categories in order to reduce total haircuts. Netting the residual position interim haircuts reflects the risk reduction inherent in hedges between positions in different categories where the price volatility is reasonably well correlated.</P>
                            <P>Section 402.2(f)(3) of the rule specifies the hedging disallowance haircut factors for the category pairs. Netting of residual position interim haircuts is permitted only between any two categories for which a hedging disallowance haircut factor is specified. Hedging disallowance haircuts are similar to offset haircuts in that they are applied to the smaller of the two residual position interim haircuts and represent the portion of the hedge being “disallowed.” A hedging disallowance haircut is determined each time two residual position interim haircuts are netted.</P>
                            <P>There are three levels of permissible netting corresponding to the three hedging disallowance haircut factors: The 20 percent, 30 percent, and 40 percent levels. It is not necessary to net all possible pairs at any one level. A greater reduction in total haircuts can sometimes be obtained by choosing not to net a pair at one level (e.g., the 20 percent level) so that one element of the pair can be netted against a third category at another level (e.g., the 30 percent level).</P>

For each pair multiply the smaller of the absolute values of the two residual position interim haircuts by the hedging disallowance haircut factor of 20 percent, and, in the category of the smaller, enter the resulting hedging disallowance haircut.</P>

                            <P>These net residual position interim haircuts replace the residual position interim haircuts (or net residual position interim haircuts) from which they were derived. Net residual position interim haircuts can in turn be used in any other allowable netting exactly as residual position interim haircuts would be. If further netting of that category at the same level is permissible and possible, it will be necessary to replace the net residual position interim haircut involved with a new (and smaller) net residual position interim haircut in column 22.</P>
                            <P>Since the net residual position interim haircut in any category containing a hedging disallowance haircut is zero, further netting with any such category is impossible.</P>

In each category, the newest (and smallest) net residual position interim haircut determined by netting at the 20 percent level replaces the old value and must be used in hedging in that category at higher levels. For each pair being netted, multiply the smaller of the absolute values of the two (net) residual position interim haircuts by the hedging disallowance haircut factor of 30 percent, and in the category of the smaller, enter the resulting hedging disallowance haircut.</P>

                        <P>Any entity, including any organizational component thereof, that previously has received recognition as a separate bidder in Treasury auctions from Treasury pursuant to 31 CFR part 356 is also recognized as a separate reporting entity without the need to request such status, provided such entity continues to be in compliance with the conditions set forth in appendix A to 31 CFR part 356.</P>

                        <P>(B) The depository institution diligently pursues with the Federal Reserve Bank the substitution of other collateral for securities determined to be customer securities; and</P>
                        <P>(C) The Federal Reserve Bank agrees that to the extent the lien extends to collateral of a value greater than the outstanding balance on the loan, customer securities will be the first collateral released from the lien.</P>
                        <P>(4)(i) To the extent that a depository institution holds securities that have been identified to such depository institution as customer securities by a government securities broker or dealer, or that the government securities broker or dealer has instructed the depository institution to place in a segregated account, in accordance with part 403 of subchapter A of this chapter, the depository institution shall treat such securities as customer securities separate from any other securities held for the account of the government securities broker or dealer and shall comply with all of the provisions of this section with respect to such customer securities, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.</P>
                        <P>(ii) A clearing bank that provides clearing services for a government securities broker or dealer and that maintains a segregated account as described in § 403.4 of this chapter shall not be required to transfer securities to such account upon the instruction of the broker or dealer for whom such account is maintained if the clearing bank determines that such securities continue to be required as collateral for an extension of clearing credit to such dealer. Whenever a clearing bank does not segregate securities as of the close of business upon the instruction of such broker or dealer, it shall send a notification to the appropriate regulatory agency of the broker or dealer for whom such account is maintained. Such securities shall thereafter be segregated pursuant to the instruction of the broker or dealer as soon as they are no longer required by the clearing bank as collateral for the extension of clearing credit.</P>
                        <P>(5) A depository institution that is subject to part 403 is not required to maintain possession or control of margin securities as that term is defined in § 403.5(f)(1).</P>
                        <P>
                            (6) Notwithstanding the requirement of paragraph (a)(1) to maintain possession or control of customer securities, a depository institution may lend such

                            securities to a third party pursuant to the written agreement of the customer, if such loan of securities is carried out in full compliance with supervisory guidelines of its appropriate regulatory agency that expressly govern securities lending practices.
                        </P>
                        <P>(b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a depository institution shall issue a confirmation or a safekeeping receipt for each security held for a customer in accordance with this section with the exception of securities that are the subject of repurchase transactions which are subject to the requirements of § 403.5(d) of this chapter. The confirmation or safekeeping receipt shall identify the issuer, maturity date, par amount and coupon rate of the security being confirmed. The confirmation may be supplied to the customer in any manner that complies with applicable Federal banking regulations.</P>
                        <P>(2) A depository institution shall not be required to send the confirmation or safekeeping receipt required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section to a customer that is a non-U.S. citizen residing outside the United States or a foreign corporation, partnership, or trust, if such customer expressly waives in writing the right to receive such confirmation or safekeeping receipt.</P>
                        <P>(c) Records of government securities held for customers shall be maintained and shall be kept separate and distinct from other records of the depository institution. Such records shall:</P>
                        <P>(1) Provide a system for identifying each customer, and each government security (or the amount of each issue of a government security issued in book-entry form) held for the customer;</P>
                        <P>(2) Describe the customer's interest in the government security;</P>
                        <P>(3) Indicate all receipts and deliveries of government securities and all receipts and disbursements of cash by the depository institution in connection with such securities;</P>
                        <P>(4) Include a copy of the safekeeping receipt or a confirmation issued for each government security held; and</P>
                        <P>(5) Provide an adequate basis for audit of such information.</P>
                        <P>(d) Counts of government securities held for customers in both definitive and book-entry form shall be conducted at least annually and such counts shall be reconciled with customer account records.</P>
                        <P>(1) Counts of book-entry securities and of definitive securities held outside the possession of the depository institution shall be made by reconciliation of the records of the depository institution with those of any depository, depository institution, or Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the depository institution has securities accounts.</P>
                        <P>(2) The depository institution conducting the count shall also verify any such securities in transfer, in transit, pledged, loaned, borrowed, deposited, failed to receive, failed to deliver, subject to repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements or otherwise subject to the depository institution's control or direction that are not in its physical possession, where the securities have been in such status for longer than thirty days.</P>
                        <P>(3) The dates and results of such counts and reconciliations shall be documented with differences noted in a security count difference account not later than seven business days after the date of each required count and verification as provided in this paragraph (d).</P>
                        <P>(e) For purposes of this section, a depository institution shall treat a government securities broker or dealer as a customer with respect to securities maintained by such government securities broker or dealer in a Segregated Account as defined in § 403.4(f)(1) of this chapter and with respect to securities otherwise identified to the depository institution as customer securities for purposes of maintaining possession or control of such securities as required by part 403 of this chapter. The recordkeeping requirements of paragraph (c) of this section require the depository institution to treat such securities as customer securities separate from any other securities held for the account of the government securities broker or dealer, but do not require the depository institution to keep records identifying individual customers of the government securities broker or dealer.</P>
                        <P>
                            (f) The records required by paragraphs (c) and (d)(3) of this section

                            shall be preserved for not less than six years, the first two years in an easily accessible place.
